# QuickVoice Top-Of-Funnel Marketing Assets

## Asset 1: Landing Page Copy

### Hero Section

#### Headline Variations

1. **Own the AI phone-agent stack your customers call into.**
2. **AI phone agents, without a black-box runtime.**
3. **Run voice agents on infrastructure your team can inspect.**

#### Subheadline

QuickVoice is AGPL, self-hostable AI phone-agent infrastructure: a Next.js console, Express/Node API, Python FastAPI service, LiveKit Agents worker, Twilio/Telnyx telephony, Postgres/Prisma, Redis/BullMQ, S3-compatible storage, Pinecone knowledge retrieval, MCP tools, call logs, and billing paths in one repo.

#### CTA Buttons

- Primary: **Inspect The Stack**
- Secondary: **Run It Locally**

#### Supporting Microcopy

Local evaluation starts with `task up:dev`. Real calls require LiveKit plus Twilio or Telnyx credentials.

### Why Open Source? Feature Grid

#### Card 1: Source-Level Runtime Control

**Technical reality:** The voice loop lives in a Python LiveKit Agents worker with Silero VAD, multilingual turn detection, telephony-aware noise cancellation, interruptible first messages, optional preemptive generation, and configurable STT, LLM, and TTS models.

**Business benefit:** Your team can review and change the call behavior instead of filing tickets against a hosted runtime you cannot see.

**Pillar:** Privacy and customization.

#### Card 2: Bring Your Own Providers

**Technical reality:** QuickVoice integrates directly with LiveKit, Twilio, Telnyx, Postgres, Prisma, Redis/BullMQ, S3-compatible object storage, Pinecone, Google embeddings, Stripe, and MCP/Smithery.

**Business benefit:** You can reason about raw infrastructure costs, vendor contracts, data residency, and failure modes without paying for an opaque bundle on every minute.

**Pillar:** Cost and provider control.

#### Card 3: Inspectable Data Paths

**Technical reality:** Call logs, transcripts, recordings, runtime config, knowledge sources, secrets, API keys, audit logs, retention jobs, and MCP execution logs are modeled in the repo. The server includes org-scoped auth, permission checks, secret references, PII redaction, safe URL validation, and zero-PII retention behavior.

**Business benefit:** Security and compliance teams can trace where voice data moves before production, then tune retention and storage to match their own policies.

**Pillar:** Privacy and auditability.

### Technical Proof Section

#### Section Headline

Trace a call through the stack.

#### Section Intro

Most hosted voice-agent APIs hide the path between carrier audio, model calls, tool execution, and persisted logs. QuickVoice turns that path into inspectable code.

#### Recommended Layout

Use a horizontal call-path diagram with clickable stages. Selecting a stage opens a side panel with the relevant runtime responsibility, technology, and source-backed proof point.

#### Call Path Stages

1. **Carrier Entry**
   - Visual: Phone call enters through Twilio or Telnyx.
   - Proof copy: Phone numbers are searched, purchased, linked, and unlinked through provider-specific server flows.

2. **LiveKit SIP**
   - Visual: Twilio/Telnyx routes the call into LiveKit SIP.
   - Proof copy: QuickVoice binds linked numbers to LiveKit trunks and dispatches rooms for inbound and outbound calls.

3. **Python Voice Worker**
   - Visual: Audio reaches the LiveKit Agents worker.
   - Proof copy: The worker handles VAD, turn detection, noise cancellation, STT, LLM, TTS, interruption behavior, and first-message playback.

4. **Runtime Config**
   - Visual: Worker requests agent config from the Express API.
   - Proof copy: Config loads by phone number or agent ID, then normalizes prompts, model IDs, language, voice, RAG, privacy settings, and MCP connections.

5. **Knowledge And Tools**
   - Visual: Optional branches to Pinecone and MCP.
   - Proof copy: Agents can retrieve Pinecone-backed context with Google embeddings and call allowlisted MCP tools through the server bridge.

6. **Post-Call Data**
   - Visual: Logs, transcripts, recordings, and usage flow back to storage.
   - Proof copy: Call logs persist in Postgres, recordings are written to S3-compatible storage, Stripe metering can report call minutes, and retention jobs clean up old records.

#### Interactive Element

Add a “closed API vs QuickVoice” toggle:

- **Closed API:** Carrier, runtime, model routing, logs, recordings, and tool calls collapse into one external box labeled “vendor-owned path.”
- **QuickVoice:** The same call expands into visible boxes for LiveKit, Express API, Python worker, Postgres, Redis, S3, Pinecone, MCP, and Stripe.

#### Final Section CTA

**Review the repo before you trust the runtime.**

## Asset 3: Developer-Focused Social Media Hooks

### Post 1: The Economic Angle

Voice-agent pricing gets expensive when the platform fee sits on top of every raw provider cost.

Simple math:

`monthly platform markup = call minutes x hosted vendor markup per minute`

At 100,000 call minutes/month:

- $0.03/min markup = $3,000/month
- $0.05/min markup = $5,000/month
- $0.08/min markup = $8,000/month

That is before the underlying costs you are already paying for in some form: telephony, STT, LLM tokens, TTS, recordings, storage, logs, and infrastructure.

QuickVoice takes a different route.

It is AGPL, self-hostable AI phone-agent infrastructure built with LiveKit Agents, Twilio/Telnyx, Express/Node, Python/FastAPI, Postgres/Prisma, Redis/BullMQ, S3-compatible storage, Pinecone, and Stripe usage hooks.

You still pay your real providers. You just stop treating the entire voice stack as an opaque per-minute bundle.

Bring your own infrastructure. Inspect the call path. Decide what the margin should be.

### Post 2: The Security / Infosec Angle

The fastest way to stall an AI voice project:

“We send customer calls to a hosted API, and the vendor handles the rest.”

Security hears:

- Where are recordings stored?
- Are transcripts retained?
- Which model providers touch the call?
- Can we redact PII before persistence?
- Who can access call logs?
- Can we delete old transcripts?
- How are tool calls audited?
- What happens if the vendor changes the runtime?

That is a hard review when the runtime is a black box.

QuickVoice is built for teams that need to answer those questions from source.

The repo includes the LiveKit worker, Express API, Python FastAPI service, Postgres schema, Redis/BullMQ queues, S3 recording path, call-log ingestion, PII redaction, zero-PII retention behavior, encrypted secret references, audit logs, retention jobs, and MCP tool execution logs.

It does not magically make a deployment compliant.

It does make the data path inspectable before sensitive voice traffic touches production.

### Post 3: The Customization / Hackability Angle

Most voice-agent platforms let you tune prompts.

That is useful. It is not the same as owning the runtime.

With QuickVoice, the voice-agent loop is in the repo:

- Python LiveKit Agents worker
- Silero VAD
- multilingual turn detection
- telephony-aware noise cancellation
- interruptible first message
- optional preemptive generation
- configurable STT, LLM, and TTS model IDs
- Pinecone-backed RAG
- MCP tool allowlisting
- call-log finalization

Want to change how interruptions work?

Want to change when retrieval runs?

Want to block side-effect tools during live calls?

Want outbound campaigns to inject different first messages, voices, languages, or dynamic variables per recipient?

Those are source-level changes, not support tickets.

QuickVoice is for teams that want a productized AI phone-agent stack without giving up the right to modify the stack.
