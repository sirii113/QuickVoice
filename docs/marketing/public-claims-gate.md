# Public Claims Gate

QuickVoice launch copy must be traceable to public evidence or framed as a conditional workflow, evaluation question, roadmap item, or illustrative scenario.

This gate applies to the website, README, launch posts, directory listings, screenshots, structured data, demos, sales collateral, and contributor materials. A claim is not approved merely because similar wording already exists in the repository.

## Blocked Until Evidence Exists

Do not publish these as QuickVoice facts without an approved registry entry and a reviewable source:

- customer, user, company, deployment, or call-volume counts;
- customer logos, testimonials, quotes, or case-study outcomes;
- ROI, cost savings, conversion, automation, satisfaction, latency, uptime, accuracy, or reliability metrics;
- HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, HITRUST, GDPR, CCPA, TCPA, FDCPA, or other certification and compliance statements;
- BAA, SLA, audit, penetration-test, data-center, or incident-response commitments;
- native integrations, provider partnerships, automatic language detection, or fixed language counts;
- "no setup", "no code", "instant", "unlimited", "never miss", or fixed deployment-time promises;
- competitor superiority, price, latency, quality, or feature claims without a dated comparison source.

## Safe Claim Types

The following are suitable when they match the current code and documentation:

- repository contents and routes that a reviewer can inspect;
- the AGPL-3.0 license and its high-level obligations, with a non-legal-advice note;
- local-development commands and their documented prerequisites;
- provider requirements for LiveKit, Twilio or Telnyx, speech, models, storage, OAuth, billing, and email;
- architecture and data-path descriptions tied to named source files;
- explicit limitations and shared-responsibility boundaries;
- illustrative scenarios that are visibly labeled and never presented as customer proof.

## Evidence Registry Contract

An approved claim record should include:

1. stable claim ID;
2. exact approved wording;
3. classification: code-backed, contract-backed, audited, customer-approved, third-party sourced, conditional, illustrative, roadmap, or prohibited;
4. public source URL or internal evidence owner;
5. scope and exclusions;
6. approver;
7. approval and expiry dates;
8. every public surface using the claim.

Expired claims return to blocked status.

## Automated Audit

Run:

```sh
node scripts/audit-public-claims.mjs
```

For machine-readable output:

```sh
node scripts/audit-public-claims.mjs --json
```

To prove a campaign destination independently of the unresolved legacy-site
backlog, pass one or more repository-relative targets:

```sh
node scripts/audit-public-claims.mjs \
  --target apps/web/src/app/open-source \
  --target apps/web/src/components/open-source
```

`--target` accepts a supported public-content file or directory and may be
repeated. It rejects missing paths and paths outside the repository.

The audit intentionally exits non-zero while potential unsupported claims remain. It is a launch-readiness gate, not a guarantee that all surviving copy is correct.

An approved exception may add `claims-audit: allow CLAIM-ID` beside the exact claim only after the evidence registry contains that claim ID. Broad file-level suppressions are not allowed.

## Launch Decision

Do not scale directory submissions, paid placement, earned-media outreach, or a flagship launch while this audit is failing on pages that the campaign will send traffic to.

The first launch path should point to the repository or `/open-source`, where claims are limited to inspectable code, documented setup requirements, provider boundaries, and licensing.
