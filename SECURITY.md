# Security Policy

QuickVoice handles telephony workflows, customer data, credentials, recordings, transcripts, and runtime agent configuration. The project is open source so teams can inspect these paths before they trust them. Please report security issues privately.

## Reporting A Vulnerability

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting for this repository if it is available.

If private reporting is unavailable, contact:

```text
security@quickvoice.co
```

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue.
- Affected components or paths.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Potential impact.
- Any suggested mitigation.

Do not open a public issue for an unpatched vulnerability.

## Scope

Security reports are most useful when they involve:

- Authentication or authorization bypasses.
- Exposure of API keys, tokens, call data, recordings, transcripts, or customer data.
- Server-side request forgery, injection, or remote code execution.
- Unsafe handling of uploads, webhooks, telephony callbacks, or runtime agent configuration.
- Privacy leaks across organizations, knowledge bases, call logs, campaigns, or provider integrations.
- Vulnerabilities in deployment defaults or local development scripts that could leak secrets.

## Response

We aim to acknowledge valid reports promptly, investigate impact, and coordinate a fix before public disclosure. Timelines depend on severity and the complexity of the affected component.
