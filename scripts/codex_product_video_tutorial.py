Rules:
- Do not edit any repository files.
- Do not create, delete, format, migrate, or commit any repository files.
- Do not write tutorial files yourself; the parent runner will save your final Markdown if it passes validation.
- You may inspect files and run read-only checks, but do not run commands that rewrite tracked files.
- This is one module in a sequential tutorial run; return a complete tutorial package for this module only.
- Do not ask to move to the next module. The runner will stop unless this module is finished successfully.
- Write for an end business user, workspace owner, operations lead, or customer success team member, not for an engineer.
- Create production-ready written assets for a video tutorial: scene-by-scene storyboard, voiceover, screen actions, captions, callouts, demo data, and recording checklist.
- Show every important feature in scope with exact UI routes, visible labels, states, forms, tables, dialogs, filters, empty states, errors, and confirmation flows when you can prove them from the repository.
- Include realistic test data and expected results from repo seed files, fixtures, testing guides, source code, and visible UI copy when discoverable.
- No invented customers, fake production metrics, unsupported vendor claims, or real credentials.
- Clearly mark provider-gated or credential-gated steps as blocked or optional instead of pretending they work in a fresh clone.
- Cover business outcomes: what the user is trying to accomplish, why each step matters, and what success looks like.
- Cover trust and safety: tenant boundaries, roles, permissions, billing implications, privacy, call recordings, transcripts, secrets, and auditability where relevant.
- Make the video self-contained enough that a producer can record it without guessing what to click, say, zoom into, or verify.
- Keep the module focused; reference adjacent modules only when the user naturally navigates there.

Return Markdown only. It must contain these exact headings:

Rules:
- Do not edit any repository files.
- Do not create, delete, format, migrate, or commit any repository files.
- Do not write tutorial files yourself; the parent runner will save your final Markdown if it passes validation.
- You may inspect files and run read-only checks, but do not run commands that rewrite tracked files.
- This is one module in a sequential tutorial run; return a complete tutorial package for this module only.
- Do not ask to move to the next module. The runner will stop unless this module is finished successfully.
- Write for an end business user, workspace owner, operations lead, or customer success team member, not for an engineer.
- Create production-ready written assets for a video tutorial: scene-by-scene storyboard, voiceover, screen actions, captions, callouts, demo data, and recording checklist.
- Show every important feature in scope with exact UI routes, visible labels, states, forms, tables, dialogs, filters, empty states, errors, and confirmation flows when you can prove them from the repository.
- Include realistic test data and expected results from repo seed files, fixtures, testing guides, source code, and visible UI copy when discoverable.
- No invented customers, fake production metrics, unsupported vendor claims, or real credentials.
- Clearly mark provider-gated or credential-gated steps as blocked or optional instead of pretending they work in a fresh clone.
- Cover business outcomes: what the user is trying to accomplish, why each step matters, and what success looks like.
- Cover trust and safety: tenant boundaries, roles, permissions, billing implications, privacy, call recordings, transcripts, secrets, and auditability where relevant.
- Make the video self-contained enough that a producer can record it without guessing what to click, say, zoom into, or verify.
- Keep the module focused; reference adjacent modules only when the user naturally navigates there.

Return Markdown only. It must contain these exact headings:
