## Summary
Improved QuickVoice’s first 30-second GitHub experience with a clearer README hook, immediate product visual, faster quick-start flow, and aligned homepage hero/browser metadata.

## Changes Made
- Updated [README.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/README.md) with:
  - sharper open-source/self-hostable positioning
  - existing console preview image placement near the top
  - new 30-second tour and stack diagram
  - copy-paste-first `task up:dev` quick start
  - clearer credential boundaries for real calls and providers
- Added [docs/launch/time-to-wow.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/docs/launch/time-to-wow.md) to document the TTW promise and demo/claims guardrails.
- Updated homepage hero copy in [3dglobe.tsx](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/apps/web/src/components/mvpblocks/3dglobe.tsx).
- Updated web title/social/PWA metadata in [layout.tsx](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx) and [manifest.ts](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/apps/web/src/app/manifest.ts).

## Deferred Or Unresolved
- Existing deeper web marketing sections still contain claim-heavy copy around compliance, customers, speed, and metrics. I did not rewrite those because confirming them needs product/legal evidence.
- Browser smoke reproduced an existing React hydration mismatch in the homepage partner-logo marquee below the hero.
- Pre-existing unrelated dirty files were left untouched: `.gitignore`, `scripts/codex_viral_launch.py`, `tests/test_codex_viral_launch.py`, `viral_launch_report.md`.

## Verification Run
- `pnpm exec prettier --check README.md docs/launch/time-to-wow.md apps/web/src/components/mvpblocks/3dglobe.tsx apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx apps/web/src/app/manifest.ts` passed.
- `pnpm --filter web check-types` passed.
- `pnpm --filter web lint` passed.
- `git diff --check -- README.md apps/web/src/components/mvpblocks/3dglobe.tsx apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx apps/web/src/app/manifest.ts` passed.
- Render smoke: started web on `http://localhost:3002` because `3001` was already in use; homepage loaded with title `QuickVoice - Open-Source AI Phone Agent Stack` and the updated hero text. Console showed the deferred hydration mismatch noted above.

#### Verification

  - Command: `git diff --check`
- `web lint`: return code `0`
  - Command: `pnpm --filter web lint`
  - Stdout:
```

  - Command: `pnpm --filter web exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`

### launchpad-playbook: Launchpad Playbook

- Status: `completed`
- Return code: `0`
- Duration: `391.9s`
- Stdout log: `.viral_launch_runs/2026-06-20T071109+0000/launchpad-playbook.stdout.jsonl`
- Stderr log: `.viral_launch_runs/2026-06-20T071109+0000/launchpad-playbook.stderr.log`

## Summary

Created coordinated launch collateral for the `launchpad-playbook` pass under `docs/launch/`. No commits or pushes were made.

## Changes Made

- Added [launchpad-playbook.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/docs/launch/launchpad-playbook.md:1) with 24-to-48-hour launch timing, response roles, guardrails, and official platform links.
- Added [show-hn-draft.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/docs/launch/show-hn-draft.md:1).
- Added [reddit-draft.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/docs/launch/reddit-draft.md:1).
- Added [x-twitter-draft.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/docs/launch/x-twitter-draft.md:1).
- Added [product-hunt-draft.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/docs/launch/product-hunt-draft.md:1).

Referenced current official guidance from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/showhn.html), [Product Hunt sharing](https://help.producthunt.com/en/articles/2690626-how-do-i-share-my-post), [Product Hunt points](https://help.producthunt.com/en/articles/11751186-product-of-the-day-week-month), and [Reddit](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/28012014962580-How-do-I-keep-spam-out-of-my-community).

## Deferred Or Unresolved

Launch-specific URLs, exact Product Hunt page details, X account, chosen subreddit, and final posting time remain placeholders because they require account/product decisions.

The worktree already had unrelated dirty files before this pass; I left them alone.

## Verification Run

- `pnpm exec prettier --check docs/launch/*.md` passed.
- Verified all five launch collateral files exist.
- Verified each channel draft contains `Timing Notes` and `Response Notes`.
- Verified the central playbook contains source links, 24-to-48-hour timing, launch-day timing, and response notes.

## Summary

Completed the `narrative-positioning` pass. QuickVoice is now framed more clearly as an open-source, self-hostable Retell alternative centered on control, privacy review, cost visibility, and extensibility, without unverifiable performance/compliance claims or hostile competitor copy.

## Changes Made

- Updated [README.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/README.md) and `package.json` positioning.
- Added contribution/community guardrails in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md`.
- Updated `docs/launch/` drafts for Show HN, Product Hunt, Reddit, X/Twitter, time-to-wow, and launch playbook.
- Reworked homepage hero/features/about/CTA/FAQ/schema copy in `apps/web/` to remove generic SaaS overclaims and emphasize self-hosting/provider boundaries.
- Added `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` and `.github/pull_request_template.md` with launch-positioning checks.

## Deferred Or Unresolved

No live credentials, paid services, or product decisions were needed.

The worktree was already dirty before this pass, including `.gitignore`, `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`, `apps/web/src/app/manifest.ts`, and some untracked launch/script files. I left unrelated existing changes intact.

### star-clipper: Star Clipper

- Status: `completed`
- Return code: `0`
- Duration: `162.9s`
- Stdout log: `.viral_launch_runs/2026-06-20T071109+0000/star-clipper.stdout.jsonl`
- Stderr log: `.viral_launch_runs/2026-06-20T071109+0000/star-clipper.stderr.log`

## Summary
Added a tasteful GitHub star CTA and momentum guidance without touching production user workflows. No commit or push was made.

## Changes Made
- Added a live GitHub stars badge and `Support The Project` section with Star History in [README.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/README.md:9).
- Added a docs-only non-code support note in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/CONTRIBUTING.md:24).
- Added Star Clipper guardrails to [docs/launch/launchpad-playbook.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/docs/launch/launchpad-playbook.md:28), explicitly banning star prompts in product, console, CLI, setup, runtime, and social launch flows.

## Deferred Or Unresolved
The worktree already had unrelated modified/untracked files at start, including an untracked `docs/` directory. I left those unrelated changes as-is.

## Verification Run
- `pnpm exec prettier --check README.md CONTRIBUTING.md docs/launch/launchpad-playbook.md` passed.
- Checked targeted star-copy matches with `rg`; prompts are limited to README, CONTRIBUTING, and launch docs.

#### Verification
- `diff check`: return code `0`
  - Command: `git diff --check`

### launch-day-responsiveness: Launch Day Responsiveness

- Status: `completed`
- Return code: `0`
- Duration: `196.5s`
- Stdout log: `.viral_launch_runs/2026-06-20T071109+0000/launch-day-responsiveness.stdout.jsonl`
- Stderr log: `.viral_launch_runs/2026-06-20T071109+0000/launch-day-responsiveness.stderr.log`

## Summary

Prepared QuickVoice for launch-day responsiveness by tightening issue/PR intake and adding a maintainer triage guide for fast, honest responses to new issues, PRs, and first-time contributors.

## Changes Made

- Added [Launch Day Triage](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/docs/launch/launch-day-triage.md) with response expectations, triage flow, good-first-issue criteria, and maintainer reply frames.
- Updated [CONTRIBUTING.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/CONTRIBUTING.md) with clearer good first contribution boundaries and launch-window response expectations.
- Expanded [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) to capture impact, repro details, credential boundaries, and first-time contributor intent.
- Expanded [.github/pull_request_template.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/.github/pull_request_template.md) with issue context, verification evidence, docs-only checks, and launch-day maintainer review notes.
- Linked the new triage guide from [docs/launch/launchpad-playbook.md](/home/ubuntu/rahul/quickvoice/docs/launch/launchpad-playbook.md).

## Deferred Or Unresolved

- I did not configure GitHub labels, responder assignments, or live issue queue ownership because those require repository/admin operations and launch-team decisions.
- The worktree already had unrelated modified/untracked files before this pass; I left them untouched.
- No commit or push was made.

## Verification Run

- `pnpm exec prettier --check CONTRIBUTING.md docs/launch/launch-day-triage.md docs/launch/launchpad-playbook.md .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md .github/pull_request_template.md` passed.
- `git diff --check -- CONTRIBUTING.md docs/launch/launch-day-triage.md docs/launch/launchpad-playbook.md .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md .github/pull_request_template.md` exited 0.
- `rg` confirmed the launch-day triage references and good-first-issue language are present across the updated docs/templates.

#### Verification
- `diff check`: return code `0`
  - Command: `git diff --check`

## Appendix: Runner Notes

- The runner never commits or pushes.
- Generated logs are stored under `.viral_launch_runs/` and ignored by git.
- A non-completed status stops later launch passes.
