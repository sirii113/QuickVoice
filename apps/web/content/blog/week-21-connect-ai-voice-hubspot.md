# How to Connect AI Voice Agents to HubSpot (Step by Step)

An AI voice agent without CRM integration is like a salesperson who doesn't take notes. They have great conversations, but nothing gets recorded, nothing gets followed up, and the organization learns nothing from the interactions.

Connecting QuickVoice to HubSpot unlocks the full value of AI voice agents: every call logged automatically, every contact updated in real time, deals created from qualified conversations, and meetings booked directly onto your team's calendars.

This guide shows you exactly how to set up the QuickVoice-HubSpot integration.

---

## What the Integration Does

Once connected, every QuickVoice AI call automatically:

**Creates and updates contact records:**
- If the caller's phone number matches an existing contact, the call is associated with that contact
- If not, a new contact is created with the caller's information
- Contact properties are updated based on information collected during the call (company name, title, email address, etc.)

**Logs call activity:**
- A call activity is logged against the contact with date, time, duration, call direction (inbound/outbound), and agent used
- Full call transcript is attached as a note
- Call recording link is stored in the contact record
- Call disposition is set (Connected, Left Voicemail, No Answer, etc.)

**Updates lifecycle stage:**
- Based on call outcome, the contact's lifecycle stage can be updated automatically
- A qualified lead call → sets to MQL or SQL
- A customer support call → no lifecycle change
- An appointment confirmed → sets a follow-up task

**Creates deals (for sales use cases):**
- When an AI qualification call meets your deal creation criteria, a deal is automatically created in your pipeline
- Deal is associated with the contact and company
- Deal stage is set based on qualification outcome

**Books meetings:**
- When a call results in a meeting booking, the meeting is created in HubSpot Meetings
- Invite sent to both the prospect and the assigned HubSpot user
- Meeting shown in the associated contact timeline

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- A QuickVoice account (Growth plan or above for HubSpot integration)
- A HubSpot account (any tier — integrations work with HubSpot Free and above)
- HubSpot admin permissions (or permission to install apps)

---

## Step 1: Access QuickVoice Integration Settings

In your QuickVoice dashboard:
1. Click **Settings** (gear icon, top right)
2. Select **Integrations** from the left sidebar
3. Click on **HubSpot**

---

## Step 2: Authenticate with HubSpot

1. Click **Connect HubSpot**
2. You'll be redirected to HubSpot's OAuth authorization page
3. Select the HubSpot account you want to connect (if you manage multiple)
4. Review the permission scopes QuickVoice requires:
   - `crm.objects.contacts.read` — read existing contact data
   - `crm.objects.contacts.write` — create and update contacts
   - `crm.objects.deals.write` — create deals (if enabled)
   - `timeline.read` and `timeline.write` — log activities to contact timelines
   - `meetings.write` — create meeting bookings
5. Click **Authorize**
6. You'll be redirected back to QuickVoice with a green "Connected" indicator

---

## Step 3: Configure Contact Matching

Tell QuickVoice how to match calls to existing HubSpot contacts:

**Primary match field:**
- **Phone number** (default — works for most use cases)
- Email (if you collect email during the call before matching)

**Match behavior for unrecognized numbers:**
- **Create new contact** (recommended for sales and support)
- **Log to unassigned queue** (if you want to manually review before creating contacts)
- **Skip logging** (not recommended — you lose valuable call data)

**Contact deduplication:**
Choose what happens when a phone number matches multiple contacts (common if the same number appears on multiple records):
- Match to most recently active contact
- Match to the contact associated with the most deals
- Log to all matching contacts

---

## Step 4: Map Call Data to HubSpot Properties

This step tells QuickVoice which data points from the call should populate which HubSpot contact properties.

### Default Mapping (Auto-Configured)

| QuickVoice Data | HubSpot Property |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Caller phone number | Phone number |
| Call date/time | Last activity date |
| Call duration | (logged in activity) |
| Call recording URL | (attached to note) |
| Full transcript | (attached as note) |
| Agent name | (logged in activity) |
| Call direction | (logged in activity) |
| Call disposition | Last contacted |

### Custom Mapping (Configure Based on Your Use Case)

For a sales use case, you may want to map:
| QuickVoice Data | HubSpot Property |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Qualified: yes/no | Lead status |
| Budget range collected | (custom property) |
| Decision timeline | (custom property) |
| Company name (collected) | Company name |
| Job title (collected) | Job title |
| Meeting booked | Next activity date |

For a support use case:
| QuickVoice Data | HubSpot Property |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Issue category | (custom property) |
| Issue resolved: yes/no | (custom property) |
| Escalation required | (custom property) |
| CSAT score (if collected) | (custom property) |

Click **Add Custom Mapping** for each additional field you want to sync.

---

## Step 5: Configure Deal Creation (Sales Use Cases Only)

If you use QuickVoice for sales qualification, configure automatic deal creation:

**Trigger:** Deal is created when:
- Call disposition = "Qualified" or "Meeting Booked"
- Or a custom condition you define (e.g., "Budget: Yes AND Authority: Yes")

**Deal properties:**
- Deal name: `[Contact Name] — QuickVoice Lead — [Date]`
- Pipeline: Select your sales pipeline
- Deal stage: Select the appropriate entry stage (e.g., "Appointment Scheduled")
- Deal owner: Assign to the contact owner or a round-robin assignment

**Association:**
- Associate with the contact
- Associate with the contact's company (if company is known)

## Step 6: Configure Meeting Booking Sync

When your AI agent books a meeting:

1. Select which HubSpot meeting link to use (or create a new one specifically for AI-booked meetings)
2. Choose how to assign meetings:
   - **Round-robin** (assign to next available team member)
   - **Contact owner** (assign to whoever owns the contact in HubSpot)
   - **Specific user** (all AI-booked meetings go to one person)
3. Select confirmation behavior:
   - Send HubSpot meeting confirmation email (recommended)
   - QuickVoice sends confirmation SMS only
   - Both

---

## Step 7: Test the Integration

Before going live, run a test:

1. Call your QuickVoice number from a phone number **not** in your HubSpot
2. Complete a brief interaction (answer a question, book a meeting if applicable)
3. In HubSpot, check if a new contact was created
4. Verify the contact has:
   - Correct phone number
   - Call activity logged in the timeline
   - Transcript note attached
   - Meeting booked (if applicable)

If everything looks correct, the integration is working.

## Advanced: HubSpot Workflow Automation

Once QuickVoice is logging to HubSpot, you can use HubSpot Workflows to automate downstream actions. Examples:

### Workflow 1: Post-Qualified-Lead Sequence
**Trigger:** Contact property "QuickVoice Qualification" = "Qualified"
**Actions:**
- Set lifecycle stage to SQL
- Assign to sales rep (round-robin)
- Enroll in HubSpot email sequence: "Post-AI-Qualification Follow-Up"
- Create task for sales rep: "Review AI call transcript and prepare for discovery call"
- Send internal Slack notification to sales manager

### Workflow 2: No-Show Follow-Up
**Trigger:** Contact property "Meeting Outcome" = "No Show"
**Actions:**
- Wait 2 hours
- Trigger QuickVoice outbound call: "Missed appointment re-engagement script"
- If no answer: send email from assigned rep

### Workflow 3: Missed Call Nurture
**Trigger:** QuickVoice call logged with disposition = "No Answer" AND contact lifecycle = "Lead"
**Actions:**
- Enroll in re-engagement email sequence
- After 3 days, trigger another QuickVoice outbound call attempt
- After 30 days of no response, set lifecycle to "Disqualified"

### Workflow 4: Closed Won → Customer Onboarding
**Trigger:** Deal stage = "Closed Won" AND deal source includes "QuickVoice"
**Actions:**
- Create HubSpot Service ticket for onboarding
- Trigger QuickVoice welcome call (onboarding check-in agent)
- Enroll contact in onboarding email sequence

## Connecting to Salesforce (Same Principles)

For Salesforce users, the QuickVoice-Salesforce integration works identically in concept:

1. Settings → Integrations → Salesforce → Connect (OAuth)
2. Map QuickVoice call data to Salesforce fields
3. Configure Lead/Contact creation logic
4. Configure Opportunity creation triggers
5. Set up Activity logging

The field mapping is configured for Salesforce standard objects (Lead, Contact, Opportunity, Task, Event) with full support for custom objects.

---

## Connecting via Zapier (Any CRM)

If your CRM doesn't have a native QuickVoice integration, use Zapier:

1. In Zapier, create a new Zap
2. **Trigger:** QuickVoice → "New Call Completed"
3. **Available trigger data:** Call timestamp, duration, transcript, recording URL, caller number, disposition, custom fields collected
4. **Action:** Connect to your CRM (Zoho, Pipedrive, Copper, Monday.com, Airtable, etc.)
5. Map QuickVoice trigger data to your CRM fields

Zapier supports 5,000+ apps. If you can receive a webhook in your tool, you can integrate QuickVoice with it.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Contacts not being created**
- Check that QuickVoice has write permissions to HubSpot contacts
- Verify that the caller's phone number is in E.164 format (+1XXXXXXXXXX)
- Ensure "create new contact" is enabled for unrecognized numbers

**Call transcripts not appearing**
- Transcription is enabled by default but can be disabled per-agent. Check agent settings.
- Transcripts may take 30–60 seconds to process after call completion

**Meetings not syncing**
- Verify that the HubSpot user account connected has meeting creation permissions
- Check that the meeting link selected is active and connected to a HubSpot user's calendar

**Duplicate contacts being created**
- Enable HubSpot's deduplication settings: Settings → Data Management → Duplicates
- In QuickVoice, set matching field to phone AND email (more strict matching)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does the integration work with HubSpot's free plan?**
Yes. The QuickVoice-HubSpot integration works with HubSpot Free, Starter, Professional, and Enterprise. Some advanced features (Workflow automation, custom reporting) require HubSpot Starter or above.

**Can we attribute revenue to specific QuickVoice agents?**
Yes. QuickVoice logs the agent name with each call. In HubSpot, you can create a custom "Source Agent" property and filter revenue attribution by agent in your reports.

**What if we have multiple QuickVoice agents for different teams?**
Each QuickVoice agent can have its own HubSpot configuration — different pipelines, different owner assignment rules, different deal properties. A sales agent creates deals; a support agent creates tickets; a scheduling agent creates meetings.
