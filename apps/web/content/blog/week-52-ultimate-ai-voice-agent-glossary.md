# The Ultimate AI Voice Agent Glossary: 100 Terms Explained

Whether you're evaluating AI voice platforms, configuring your first agent, or trying to understand vendor specifications, this glossary covers 100 key terms in plain English.

---

## A

**A/B Testing (Voice)**
Running two versions of an AI agent script or persona simultaneously to compare performance metrics (CSAT, completion rate, FCR) and identify which version performs better. Standard practice for optimizing AI voice deployments over time.

**Agent (AI)**
A software system that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve a defined goal. In AI voice, an agent is the AI system that conducts the phone call — perceiving speech, making conversational decisions, and taking actions (booking, looking up information, escalating).

**AHT (Average Handle Time)**
The average duration of an AI or human-handled call, from first utterance to call end. AI AHT is typically 30–50% lower than human AHT for equivalent call types, because AI doesn't fumble with systems or engage in off-topic conversation.

**Ambient AI**
AI that operates in the background of everyday environments (home, car, office) rather than requiring deliberate invocation. Emerging in 2026–2027; represents an expansion of AI voice beyond the phone call paradigm.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
A set of protocols allowing two software systems to communicate. In AI voice, APIs are used to connect the voice platform to external systems (CRM, calendars, order management) so the AI can read and write data in real time during calls.

**ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)**
The technology that converts spoken audio into text. Sometimes used interchangeably with STT (Speech-to-Text). Deepgram is currently the leading ASR/STT provider for telephony environments.

**Augmented Agent**
A human customer service agent whose performance is enhanced by AI tools — real-time knowledge assistance, compliance prompts, call summaries — rather than replaced by AI.

---

## B

**BANT Qualification**
A lead qualification framework: Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline. AI voice agents can be configured to collect all four BANT elements systematically in every qualifying call, ensuring consistent qualification data in the CRM.

**BAA (Business Associate Agreement)**
A HIPAA-required legal agreement between a healthcare organization and any vendor that handles Protected Health Information (PHI). An AI voice platform that processes healthcare calls involving PHI must sign a BAA. Required for legal deployment in healthcare.

**Bidirectional Integration**
An integration where data flows both from the AI platform to the connected system AND from the connected system to the AI platform. For example: QuickVoice reads available calendar slots from Google Calendar AND writes new bookings back to Google Calendar. Essential for transactional AI deployments.

**Boost Words**
Custom vocabulary additions to an STT (speech recognition) system — domain-specific terms, product names, or unusual words that the base model might misrecognize. Configured in Deepgram and other STT providers to improve recognition accuracy for specialized vocabularies (medical terms, proprietary product names, unusual surnames).

---

## C

**Cadence (Calling Cadence)**
The pattern of contact attempts for outbound AI calling campaigns — including timing, frequency, channels (voice + SMS), and retry logic. Example: Day 1 voice call → if no answer, Day 3 voice call + SMS → if no answer, Day 7 final voice call.

**CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score)**
A metric measuring customer satisfaction with an interaction, typically collected via post-call survey (1–5 scale). Industry benchmark for AI voice agents: 4.0–4.4/5.0 for resolved interactions.

**End-to-End Latency**
The total time from when a caller finishes speaking to when the AI begins responding. Includes: STT processing time + LLM inference time + TTS generation time. Industry benchmark for top platforms: 450–700ms.

**Escalation**
The process of routing a call from AI to a human agent when the call type requires human judgment, the caller requests a human, or an escalation trigger fires. Effective escalation includes context handoff to the human agent.

---

## F

**FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act)**
US federal law governing debt collection practices, including: time-of-day restrictions, required disclosures (mini-Miranda), cease communication rights, dispute handling, and prohibited practices. AI voice systems for collections must be fully FDCPA-compliant.

**FCR (First Call Resolution)**
The percentage of customer contacts resolved without the customer needing to contact again for the same issue. Industry benchmark for AI voice: 77–83% for in-scope calls.

**Guardrails**
Constraints placed on an AI system's behavior — what it can and cannot say, what topics it should or should not engage with, how it should handle out-of-scope questions. Essential for controlling AI behavior in business deployments.

---

## H

**Hallucination**
When an AI generates plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information. A significant risk in AI voice deployments — an agent that hallucinations pricing, policies, or medical information can create real harm. Prevented through: grounding AI responses in a verified knowledge base, configuring "I don't know" responses for out-of-scope questions, and regular knowledge base audits.

**Handle Time**
See AHT (Average Handle Time).

**HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**

Data format commonly used for API communication. When AI platforms send call data to external systems (CRM, calendar), it's typically transmitted as JSON. Relevant for technical integrations.

**Jump Rate**
The percentage of callers who bypass the AI entirely (immediately pressing 0 or demanding human) without engaging with the AI's content. High jump rates typically indicate either: poor call opening/greeting, negative experience with previous AI systems, or wrong caller audience for AI.

---

## K

**Knowledge Base**
The structured collection of information an AI agent draws on when answering questions — FAQs, policies, pricing, procedures, scripts. The single most important determinant of AI voice agent quality. More complete and accurate = better AI performance.

**KPI (Key Performance Indicator)**
A quantifiable metric used to evaluate success. For AI voice agents, the 10 primary KPIs are: AI completion rate, AHT, escalation rate, call volume handled, CSAT, FCR, voice quality score, cost per call, after-hours capture rate, and no-show rate (for reminder campaigns).

---

## L

**Latency**
See End-to-End Latency.

**Local Presence**
A calling technique where the AI outbound call appears to originate from a local number matching the recipient's area code, improving answer rates. Effective for outbound campaigns; regulations require proper disclosure.

---

## M

**Mini-Miranda**
The required disclosure for third-party debt collectors under FDCPA, stating: "This is [company name] attempting to collect a debt. Any information obtained will be used for that purpose." Must be delivered at the start of every collection call. AI systems can be configured to deliver mini-Miranda automatically and consistently.

**Multimodal AI**
AI systems that can handle multiple interaction types — voice, text, images, video — potentially in a single conversation. Emerging capability that enables, for example, a voice call to seamlessly continue as a text/SMS conversation with context preserved.

**Multi-Agent Architecture**

**Prompt Engineering**
The practice of designing the instructions (system prompts) given to an LLM to configure its behavior for a specific use case. In no-code AI voice platforms, prompt engineering is abstracted into UI-based configuration, but the underlying mechanism is prompt engineering.

**Prosody**
The patterns of rhythm, stress, and intonation in speech. In AI voice, prosody affects how natural the AI sounds — whether it emphasizes the right words, pauses in the right places, and varies its pace appropriately.

---

## Q

**Queue (Call Queue)**
A waiting system that holds callers until an agent (human or AI) is available. AI voice agents with unlimited concurrent call capacity effectively eliminate the queue — every caller is answered immediately.

---

## R

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
A technique where an LLM retrieves relevant information from an external knowledge base before generating a response. Used in AI voice to ensure the AI draws on verified, up-to-date information rather than relying solely on training data. Reduces hallucination risk.

**Real-Time Translation**
AI capability to understand speech in one language and respond in another, enabling multilingual conversations without separate agent configurations. Emerging technology in 2026–2027.

**Routing**

**Speaker Diarization**
The process of separating different speakers in an audio recording ("Speaker 1 said X; Speaker 2 said Y"). Used for accurate transcription of multi-party calls and for AI to properly identify when the caller vs. the agent is speaking.

**STT (Speech-to-Text)**
The technology that converts spoken audio to text. The first stage of AI voice processing. Quality STT (Deepgram) achieves 4.2% word error rate in clean telephony audio.

**Subprocessor**
A third-party vendor that processes data on behalf of a primary vendor. In AI voice compliance, relevant subprocessors include: STT provider, TTS provider, cloud hosting provider, and telephony provider. HIPAA-compliant deployments require BAAs with all relevant subprocessors.

**System Prompt**
The background instructions given to an LLM that define its role, constraints, persona, and knowledge context. In no-code AI voice platforms, the system prompt is generated automatically from the UI configuration inputs.

---

US law governing automated calls and texts, requiring prior express consent for marketing calls to mobile numbers, providing easy opt-out mechanisms, and complying with DNC lists.

**Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
The technology that converts text to synthesized speech. The final stage of AI voice response generation. Leading provider: ElevenLabs.

**Token**
The basic unit of text that LLMs process — roughly 3/4 of a word. LLM pricing is typically charged per token (input + output). Longer conversations = more tokens = higher AI cost.

**Training Data**
The text and/or audio data used to train an AI model. The quality, diversity, and scale of training data significantly affects model performance.

**Transfer (Call Transfer)**
Routing an in-progress call from AI to a human agent or another destination. Warm transfer: AI briefs the human before connecting; Cold transfer: AI connects without briefing.

**Turn-Taking**
The alternation of speaking between participants in a conversation. AI voice systems must manage turn-taking naturally — knowing when to listen, when to respond, and how to handle simultaneous speech.

---

## U

**Utterance**
A single spoken statement by a caller. The fundamental unit of analysis for speech recognition and intent detection. Each utterance produces an STT transcription and an intent classification.

**Uptime SLA**
A contractual commitment on system availability. Enterprise-grade AI voice platforms offer 99.9% uptime SLAs. Calculated as: maximum 8.76 hours of downtime per year.

---

## V

**Voice Cloning**
Creating a synthetic version of a specific person's voice, capable of speaking any text in that voice. Business applications: brand voice consistency, founder voice for campaigns, multilingual version of an existing voice.

**Voice Print**
A unique acoustic signature of an individual's voice, used for voice biometric authentication. Emerging use case for AI voice: verifying caller identity by voice print rather than PIN or password.

**Voicemail Drop**
Pre-recorded message left automatically when an outbound AI call reaches voicemail, without waiting for the beep and recording in real time. Improves campaign efficiency and message consistency.

---

## W

**Warm Transfer**
A call transfer where the AI agent briefs the receiving human agent on the caller's situation before connecting them. The human receives context before picking up, enabling faster resolution. Significantly improves CSAT and FCR for escalated calls compared to cold transfers.

**Webhook**
An automated HTTP callback that sends data from one system to another when a specific event occurs. Used to trigger AI outbound calls (e.g., new form submission → trigger AI qualification call), and to receive call data back into other systems.

**WER (Word Error Rate)**
The percentage of words in a speech recognition transcription that are incorrect. Lower is better. Deepgram WER in telephony: 4.2% (clean), 7.8% (noisy). Industry context: a 5% WER means 1 in 20 words is transcribed incorrectly — for most conversational AI use cases, this is acceptable.

**Whisper (AI Model)**
OpenAI's open-source speech recognition model, an alternative to commercial STT providers. Used in some AI voice deployments for cost reduction.

---

## X, Y, Z

**Zero-Shot Inference**
An LLM's ability to handle tasks it wasn't explicitly trained on, by applying general reasoning. Relevant for AI voice agents encountering questions slightly outside their configured knowledge base — a good LLM handles these gracefully using zero-shot reasoning rather than completely failing.
