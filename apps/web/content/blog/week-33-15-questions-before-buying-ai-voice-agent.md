# 15 Questions to Ask Before Buying an AI Voice Agent Platform

The AI voice agent market is crowded, and vendor marketing is optimistic. Before committing to any platform, ask these 15 questions. The answers will reveal the real capabilities, hidden costs, and risk factors.

---

## Section 1: Voice Quality and Performance

### Q1: What is your end-to-end response latency?

**Why it matters:** Latency is the time between when a caller finishes speaking and when the AI begins responding. Above 1,200ms, callers feel the conversation is stilted. Above 1,500ms, they think the call has dropped.

**What to ask for:** A live demonstration, not a spec sheet. Call their demo line and experience the latency yourself.

**Good answer:** Consistently under 800ms in live calls. Under 600ms is excellent.

**Red flag:** "Our latency is typically 800ms" with no live demo. Always hear it yourself.

**QuickVoice answer:** Average end-to-end latency under 700ms. Available for live demonstration.

---

### Q2: What TTS and STT providers do you use?

**Why it matters:** The quality of the voice and speech recognition is determined entirely by the underlying providers. There are significant differences between providers in naturalness, accent handling, and accuracy in noisy environments.

**Good answer:** ElevenLabs (TTS) + Deepgram (STT) = best-in-class combination. Also acceptable: Azure Neural TTS + Deepgram, or Google WaveNet + AssemblyAI.

**Red flag:** "Proprietary technology" without naming underlying providers — often means lower-cost alternatives.

---

### Q3: Can you show me call recordings from real deployments?

**Why it matters:** Marketing demos are scripted for the ideal scenario. Real customer call recordings show how the AI handles unexpected questions, strange accents, background noise, and off-topic inputs.

**Good answer:** Yes, with customer permission, here are anonymized recordings from [industry] deployments.

**Red flag:** "We don't share customer data" when applied to anonymized, consent-given recording samples. Every reputable platform has reference customers willing to share.

---

## Section 2: Compliance and Security

### Q4: Do you provide a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA)?

**Why it matters:** If you're in healthcare (or any industry handling health information), this is legally required. No BAA = illegal to use for healthcare.

**Good answer:** Yes, we provide a BAA for Scale and Enterprise plans. Here is our BAA template.

**Red flag:** "We're working on our HIPAA compliance" or "we take security seriously" without a signed BAA.

---

### Q5: Are you SOC 2 Type II certified?

**Why it matters:** SOC 2 Type II certifies that an independent auditor has verified your security controls over a period of time (minimum 6 months). It's meaningfully different from SOC 2 Type I (a point-in-time snapshot) or simply "SOC 2 compliant" (self-attested).

**Good answer:** Yes. Here is our most recent SOC 2 Type II audit report (or summary, if full report requires NDA).

**Red flag:** "We follow SOC 2 principles" or "SOC 2 compliance is coming" — these are not certifications.

---

### Q6: Who are your subprocessors, and are they all HIPAA-compliant?

**Why it matters:** Your compliance is only as strong as your weakest subprocessor. If the vendor uses a non-compliant TTS or STT provider that touches your caller data, that's a gap in your compliance chain.

**Good answer:** Full list of subprocessors disclosed. All relevant subprocessors have BAAs in place. Key ones: [STT provider], [TTS provider], [cloud hosting], [telephony].

**Red flag:** "Subprocessor information is confidential."

---

### Q7: Where is customer data processed and stored?

**Why it matters:** Some regulated industries (healthcare, government) require US-only data residency. EU customers may require GDPR-compliant data handling within the EU.

**Good answer:** All customer data processed and stored in US-based AWS data centers (us-east-1, us-west-2). EU option available for European customers.

**Red flag:** "Data may be processed in multiple global regions" without further specification.

---

## Section 3: Integrations and Technical Capabilities

### Q8: How does the integration with [our CRM/scheduling system] work?

**Why it matters:** The value of an AI voice agent multiplies when it can read from and write to your existing systems. The quality of integrations varies enormously — from "bidirectional real-time sync with field mapping" to "we send a webhook you need to process."

**What to demonstrate:** Ask for a live demo of a call that creates a contact in your CRM, logs the transcript, and books a meeting. Watch the entire flow end-to-end.

**Good answer:** One-click native integration with [your system]. Real-time bidirectional sync. Configurable field mapping. No code required.

**Red flag:** "We support any system via webhooks" — this means you need a developer.

---

### Q9: How do you handle calls when your AI can't answer the question?

**Why it matters:** Every AI has a knowledge limit. How it handles the edge of its knowledge determines caller experience quality.

**Good answer:** The agent acknowledges the gap gracefully and offers a specific alternative: transfer to a human, take a message with callback promise, or recommend a resource. No dead-end "I don't understand that."

**Red flag:** No clear configuration option for fallback behavior. "It's handled by the AI" without specifics.

---

### Q10: What is your uptime SLA?

**Why it matters:** If your AI voice agent goes down, every call fails. For businesses that route all calls through AI, this is a critical outage.

**Good answer:** 99.9% or higher SLA with documented incident response. Here is our status page and incident history.

**Red flag:** No public SLA or no status page.

---

## Section 4: Pricing and Contracts

### Q11: What are all the costs — including overages?

**Why it matters:** Many platforms have attractive base prices with punishing overage rates. A campaign that exceeds your plan's included minutes can generate a bill 3–5x the expected monthly cost.

**What to ask:** "If I use 200% of my included minutes in a month, what do I pay?"

**Good answer:** Overage rate clearly specified (e.g., $0.12/minute for minutes above plan). No automatic upgrades without consent. Billing alerts available.

**Red flag:** "We'll work something out" or rates not listed in the standard pricing document.

---

### Q12: What is the contract length and cancellation policy?

**Why it matters:** Long-term contracts create leverage for vendors and risk for buyers. For a category that's evolving as fast as AI voice, a 2-year contract signed today may lock you into yesterday's technology at today's prices.

**Good answer:** Month-to-month with 30-day cancellation. Annual discounts available but not required.

**Red flag:** Minimum 12-month contract with automatic renewal and 90-day cancellation notice.

---

### Q13: What happens to our data if we cancel?

**Why it matters:** Your call recordings, transcripts, and customer data should be exportable and deletable on your schedule.

**Good answer:** Upon cancellation, you receive an export of all call data within 30 days. After 60 days, all data is permanently deleted from our systems. You can also request immediate deletion at any time.

**Red flag:** No clear data portability or deletion policy.

---

## Section 5: Support and Onboarding

### Q14: What does onboarding support look like?

**Why it matters:** The difference between a successful AI deployment and a failed one is often the quality of the initial setup. Poorly configured agents create bad caller experiences that undermine the entire investment.

**Good answer:** Dedicated onboarding specialist for the first 30 days. Template review and optimization before launch. Access to recorded training and documentation.

**Red flag:** "Here's our documentation portal" — self-serve only for a complex business tool.

---

### Q15: How do you handle it if the AI starts giving wrong information?

**Why it matters:** AI knowledge bases become outdated. Pricing changes. Policies change. Products change. What happens to calls made with outdated information, and how quickly can you correct it?

**Good answer:** You can update any knowledge base entry in real time from the dashboard. Changes take effect within 60 seconds. For critical corrections, you can temporarily pause the agent while updating. Call recordings let you audit what information was given.

**Red flag:** "Our AI is always learning and updating" — this is not an answer. You need manual control over what your agent says.
