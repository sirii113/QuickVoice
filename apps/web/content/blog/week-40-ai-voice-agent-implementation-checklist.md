# AI Voice Agent Implementation Checklist: 20 Steps to a Successful Launch

The difference between an AI voice agent that transforms your business and one that frustrates callers and gets turned off after two weeks is almost always implementation quality — not the underlying technology.

This 20-step checklist covers everything you need to do before, during, and after launch. Print it, assign owners to each step, and don't go live until every item is checked.

---

## Phase 1: Strategy and Planning (Steps 1–5)

### Step 1: Define the Primary Use Case

Before configuring anything, be specific about what the AI agent will do.

**What to decide:**
- [ ] What specific call types will the AI handle? (scheduling, order status, lead qualification, collections, FAQ, etc.)
- [ ] Will it handle inbound calls, outbound calls, or both?
- [ ] What is the agent's #1 goal? (appointments booked, leads qualified, calls deflected from human agents, after-hours coverage)
- [ ] What will the agent explicitly NOT handle? (define scope boundaries)

**Why it matters:** Agents configured with a clear primary function outperform agents trying to do everything. Start narrow; expand later.

### Step 2: Map Your Current Call Volume and Types

Understand what you're automating before you automate it.

**What to gather:**
- [ ] Total inbound call volume per month
- [ ] Breakdown of call types by percentage (scheduling = X%, FAQ = Y%, complaints = Z%)
- [ ] Peak hours and days
- [ ] After-hours call volume
- [ ] Current average handle time per call type
- [ ] Current cost per call (if available)

**Source:** Pull from your phone system (most include analytics), CRM call logs, or simply ask your team.

### Step 3: Define Your Escalation Policy

Every AI agent needs clear rules for when to hand off to a human.

**What to decide:**
- [ ] What triggers immediate escalation? (emergencies, complaints, out-of-scope questions, caller frustration)
- [ ] Where do escalations go? (live transfer to staff, voicemail, scheduled callback)
- [ ] What are your staffed hours for live transfer?
- [ ] What happens to escalations that arrive after hours? (emergency paging, next-day callback, on-call number)
- [ ] Define "emergency" criteria for your business (specific, not vague)

### Step 4: Identify Compliance Requirements

**Regulated industries:** Complete this step before any configuration.

- [ ] **Healthcare:** HIPAA certification required, BAA required from platform, US data residency required
- [ ] **Collections:** FDCPA compliance required — time restrictions, mini-Miranda, cease communication processing, dispute handling
- [ ] **Financial services:** CFPB AI guidance compliance, state regulations, PCI DSS if taking payments
- [ ] **All outbound calls:** TCPA compliance — consent documentation, opt-out processing, DNC list scrubbing
- [ ] **All calls (27 states + federal FTC guidance):** AI disclosure — agent must identify as AI when asked
- [ ] **EU customers:** GDPR data handling requirements

### Step 5: Choose Your Phone Number Strategy

**What to decide:**
- [ ] Will the AI use your existing business number? (requires phone number porting or call forwarding setup)
- [ ] Or a new AI-specific number? (faster to deploy; existing number continues to human agents initially)
- [ ] For outbound campaigns: Will you use local presence numbers (match caller's area code) or fixed numbers?
- [ ] Toll-free vs. local number for inbound?

**Recommendation:** Start with a new AI number while human agents keep the main line. After validating AI performance, migrate main number to AI with human escalation as fallback. This reduces risk during the initial deployment phase.

## Phase 2: Configuration (Steps 6–12)

### Step 6: Build Your Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is the AI's source of truth. More thorough = better performance.

**Minimum knowledge base (30+ items for a basic agent):**
- [ ] Company name, address, phone number, business hours
- [ ] Services offered (with descriptions, not just names)
- [ ] Pricing (specific figures or "how to get a quote")
- [ ] Service area / eligibility criteria
- [ ] Top 20–30 FAQ answers (verbatim, in spoken voice — not bullet points)
- [ ] Appointment booking process and confirmation behavior
- [ ] Cancellation and rescheduling policy
- [ ] Emergency criteria and procedures
- [ ] Team/staff names for transfer purposes
- [ ] What information NOT to share (HIPAA-protected information, confidential pricing, anything needing human judgment)

**Building tip:** Pull from your actual FAQ page, train new hires documentation, and your top customer service emails. These contain the real questions customers ask.

### Step 7: Configure Your Agent Persona

- [ ] Choose agent name (first name only; must sound natural)
- [ ] Set tone guidelines (3–4 adjectives: professional, warm, efficient, concise)
- [ ] Define language style (formal vs. casual; technical vs. plain language)
- [ ] Configure opening greeting (include company name and agent name)
- [ ] Configure closing script (consistent, warm, action-oriented)
- [ ] Set pacing preferences (slower for healthcare/legal; faster for transactional)
- [ ] Configure disclosure response (what the agent says when asked "are you a real person?")

### Step 8: Design Conversation Flows for Each Call Type

For each primary call type, map the full conversation path:

**Template for each call type:**
- [ ] Intent recognition: What phrases indicate this call type?
- [ ] Information needed: What must the AI collect?
- [ ] Actions: What does the AI do with the information? (book, look up, escalate, log)
- [ ] Confirmation: What does the AI confirm back to the caller?
- [ ] Close: How does this specific call type end?
- [ ] Edge cases: What unexpected directions can this conversation take?

Do this for every call type before moving to integration.

### Step 9: Set Up Calendar Integration

For appointment-based businesses:

- [ ] Connect calendar system (Google Calendar, Outlook, Calendly, or booking system)
- [ ] Define bookable time slots (which slots is AI allowed to fill?)
- [ ] Set buffer times between appointments
- [ ] Configure confirmation message (SMS and/or email)
- [ ] Configure reminder schedule (e.g., 48-hour voice call + 2-hour SMS)
- [ ] Test live booking with a real calendar slot
- [ ] Verify confirmation delivery (SMS + email arrive correctly)
- [ ] Test cancellation/rescheduling flow

### Step 10: Set Up CRM Integration

- [ ] Connect CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, or equivalent)
- [ ] Map caller data to CRM fields (name, phone, email, call type, disposition)
- [ ] Configure contact creation for new callers
- [ ] Configure activity logging (call transcript, summary, disposition)
- [ ] Set up lead routing rules (hot leads notify SDR immediately)
- [ ] Test: Make a test call, verify contact created in CRM, verify transcript logged
- [ ] Configure duplicate handling (what happens when phone number already exists?)

### Step 11: Configure Compliance Features

- [ ] Enable call recording (with appropriate state law compliance — some states require two-party consent disclosure at call start)
- [ ] Configure call recording disclosure at call start (if required)
- [ ] Enable DNC list scrubbing for outbound campaigns
- [ ] Configure opt-out processing ("stop calling me" → add to opt-out list automatically)
- [ ] For HIPAA: Verify data encryption in transit and at rest, US data residency active
- [ ] For collections: Configure mini-Miranda delivery, time-of-day calling restrictions, dispute handling escalation
- [ ] Enable AI identification disclosure for all calls

### Step 12: Configure Outbound Campaign Settings (If Applicable)

- [ ] Define calling list (source, format, deduplication)
- [ ] Set calling hours (time zone logic for each contact)
- [ ] Configure ring attempts (how many rings before voicemail?)
- [ ] Configure voicemail drop message
- [ ] Set retry cadence (how many attempts per contact? How many days between attempts?)
- [ ] Configure call recording storage duration
- [ ] Test: Run 5 test calls to verified test numbers, verify all flows work end-to-end

## Phase 3: Testing (Steps 13–16)

### Step 13: Internal Acceptance Testing (20+ Scenarios)

Before anyone outside your team calls the agent, run structured internal tests. Create a test script with at least 20 scenarios:

**Must-test scenarios:**
- [ ] Standard booking / inquiry (best case)
- [ ] Rescheduling / cancellation
- [ ] FAQ question from knowledge base
- [ ] Question not in knowledge base (should gracefully escalate)
- [ ] "I want to speak to a human" (should escalate immediately, not argue)
- [ ] "Are you a real person?" (must answer honestly)
- [ ] Emergency call (must escalate immediately and correctly)
- [ ] Angry/frustrated caller (must de-escalate and offer escalation)
- [ ] Caller mumbles or speaks quietly (should ask for clarification gracefully)
- [ ] Caller gives wrong information (should gently correct and proceed)
- [ ] Long silence mid-call (should prompt caller appropriately)
- [ ] Caller goes off-topic (should acknowledge and redirect)
- [ ] Multiple requests in one turn (should address each in order)
- [ ] After-hours call (should handle correctly per after-hours configuration)
- [ ] Pricing question (should give correct response per knowledge base)
- [ ] Complaint call (should handle with empathy and escalation path)
- [ ] Call in language other than English (if multilingual configured)
- [ ] Voicemail (for outbound — should leave correct voicemail message)
- [ ] DNC number (for outbound — should not call)
- [ ] Duplicate CRM contact (should match, not duplicate)

**Evaluation for each scenario:**
- [ ] AI understood the caller intent correctly
- [ ] Response was in line with knowledge base and persona
- [ ] Call flowed naturally
- [ ] Desired outcome achieved (booking made, escalation triggered, FAQ answered)

### Step 14: Quality Test — Listen to All Recordings

After internal testing, listen to every test call recording:

- [ ] Does the voice sound natural and appropriate for your brand?
- [ ] Is the pace correct for your customer base?
- [ ] Are there any responses that feel robotic, canned, or inappropriate?
- [ ] Are there any moments where the AI "misunderstands" in a way that would frustrate real callers?
- [ ] Does the closing feel warm and complete?

Document all issues. Fix before proceeding.

### Step 15: Soft Launch — Limited Live Testing

Before full deployment, run a controlled soft launch:

**Approach 1: After-hours only**
Deploy AI for after-hours calls only (e.g., 6pm–8am). Human agents handle all business-hours calls. Run for 1–2 weeks.

**Approach 2: Percentage routing**
Route 20% of inbound calls to AI; 80% to humans. Gradually increase AI percentage as confidence builds.

**Approach 3: One use case at a time**
Deploy AI for scheduling calls only; route all other calls to humans. Add additional call types as each is validated.

**Soft launch monitoring:**
- [ ] Review 100% of AI call transcripts daily
- [ ] Track escalation rate (too high = configuration issue; too low = missing escalation triggers)
- [ ] Monitor CSAT from post-call survey
- [ ] Look for knowledge base gaps (questions AI can't answer)
- [ ] Verify integrations are working (bookings appearing in calendar, contacts in CRM)

### Step 16: Staff Briefing and Training

Your human team needs to understand what the AI is doing and how to work with it:

- [ ] Brief all customer-facing staff on AI deployment before go-live
- [ ] Explain what calls the AI handles vs. what it escalates
- [ ] Train on how to receive AI-escalated calls (the AI should brief the human on the call context before handoff)
- [ ] Train on how to update the AI knowledge base when information changes
- [ ] Train on how to review AI call transcripts and flag issues
- [ ] Set expectation: AI calls may sound different from human calls; staff should not treat escalated calls as complaints about AI

---

## Phase 4: Launch and Post-Launch (Steps 17–20)

### Step 17: Full Launch Configuration

- [ ] Complete soft launch period with satisfactory performance
- [ ] Fix all knowledge base gaps identified during soft launch
- [ ] Set final phone number configuration (main line → AI, with escalation to staff)
- [ ] Enable full outbound campaign if applicable
- [ ] Confirm all integrations running correctly in production
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting (QuickVoice dashboard, integration error notifications)
- [ ] Document emergency procedures: How do you manually disable the AI if needed?

### Step 18: Monitor Week 1 Intensively

The first week of full deployment requires active monitoring:

- [ ] Review 50%+ of transcripts daily (sample across all call types)
- [ ] Track daily metrics: call volume, AI completion rate, escalation rate, CSAT
- [ ] Compare to baseline (before AI metrics) where available
- [ ] Fix any knowledge base issues same-day
- [ ] Check integrations daily (are bookings appearing correctly? CRM records complete?)
- [ ] Conduct daily team check-in: Any issues raised by staff on escalated calls?

### Step 19: Establish Ongoing Improvement Process

AI agents improve with maintenance. Build this into your regular operations:

- [ ] Assign one owner for AI agent maintenance (10–15 min/week)
- [ ] Weekly: Review transcripts for knowledge base gaps and fix
- [ ] Monthly: Review aggregate metrics (completion rate, CSAT, escalation rate) and identify trends
- [ ] Quarterly: Review full call type distribution — have any new call types emerged that need new flows?
- [ ] When business changes: Update knowledge base same-day (new services, pricing changes, policy changes, staff changes)
- [ ] Schedule quarterly call with QuickVoice onboarding/support to review performance and identify optimization opportunities

### Step 20: Measure and Report ROI

Within 90 days of launch, measure your actual ROI:

**Metrics to capture:**
- [ ] Call volume: before vs. after
- [ ] After-hours call handling: calls captured that were previously missed
- [ ] Cost per call: before vs. after (total cost / total calls)
- [ ] Human agent time saved: hours per week freed from routine calls
- [ ] Appointment/booking volume: before vs. after
- [ ] No-show rate: before vs. after (if using reminders)
- [ ] Customer satisfaction: before vs. after (post-call CSAT)
- [ ] New customer conversion: any improvement from faster response?

**Calculate:**
- Monthly savings (labor cost reduction + after-hours revenue)
- ROI = (Monthly savings - Monthly AI cost) / Monthly AI cost × 100%

Document and share this with stakeholders. Successful ROI measurement creates organizational buy-in for expanding AI voice to additional use cases.
