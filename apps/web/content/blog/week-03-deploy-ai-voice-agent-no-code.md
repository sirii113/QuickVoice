# How to Deploy an AI Voice Agent in 2 Minutes (No Code)

Two years ago, building an AI voice agent required a team of engineers, weeks of work, and a six-figure budget. In 2026, you can deploy a production-ready AI phone agent in under two minutes using QuickVoice — no code, no engineers, no waiting.

This guide walks you through the exact steps to build, configure, test, and launch an AI voice agent for your business. By the time you finish reading this, you could already be live.

---

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you will have:

- A fully configured AI voice agent with a custom persona and voice
- A complete conversational script tailored to your business
- Integration with your calendar or CRM
- A dedicated phone number your customers can call
- Real-time analytics on every call

**Time required:** 2–15 minutes depending on how much customization you want.

**Technical knowledge required:** None. If you can fill out a form, you can do this.

---

## Before You Start: Three Things to Prepare

Before logging into QuickVoice, take 5 minutes to collect these items. Having them ready will make the setup go faster.

### 1. Your Business FAQ (10–20 questions)

Write down the 10–20 questions you hear most from callers. For example:
- What are your business hours?
- Where are you located?
- How much does [service/product] cost?
- Do you accept [insurance/credit cards]?
- How do I reschedule my appointment?

You don't need to write perfect answers yet. Rough notes are fine — you'll refine them during setup.

### 2. Your Escalation Rules

Decide: what types of calls should the AI handle, and what should be transferred to a human? Be specific.

Examples:
- Handle: general questions, appointment booking, basic support
- Transfer to human: billing disputes, complaints, calls about specific patient names, anything the AI can't resolve

### 3. Your Calendar or CRM Login

If you want the agent to book appointments or look up customer records, have your Google Calendar, HubSpot, Salesforce, or scheduling system login ready.

---

## Step 1: Create Your QuickVoice Account

Go to [quickvoice.co](https://quickvoice.co) and click **Start Free Trial**. Enter your email and create a password. No credit card is required for the trial.

After signing up, you'll land on the **Agent Dashboard** — the central hub for building and managing your AI voice agents.

---

## Step 2: Create a New Agent

Click **+ New Agent** in the top right corner of the dashboard.

You'll see a setup wizard that walks you through four sections:

1. **Agent Profile** — name, persona, voice
2. **Knowledge Base** — what the agent knows
3. **Conversation Flow** — how the agent handles different scenarios
4. **Integrations** — what systems the agent connects to

Let's go through each one.

---

## Step 3: Configure Your Agent Profile

### Agent Name
Give your agent a human name. Customers respond better to named agents than to "our AI system."

Good examples: *Aria*, *Jordan*, *Alex*, *Sam*, *Morgan*

Avoid: *Bot*, *AI Assistant*, *System*, *Operator*

### Agent Persona
Write 2–3 sentences describing who this agent is. This becomes part of the agent's system prompt.

**Example for a dental practice:**
> "You are Aria, the patient care coordinator for Bright Smile Dental. You are warm, professional, and patient. You help patients schedule appointments, answer questions about our services, and handle any concerns they have about their care."

**Example for a real estate team:**
> "You are Jordan, a licensed assistant for the Premier Homes team. You are knowledgeable about real estate in the Greater Boston area, friendly but professional, and focused on connecting serious buyers and sellers with our agents."

### Voice Selection
QuickVoice offers 40+ voices across genders, ages, accents, and styles. Preview each voice before selecting. Pay attention to:

- **Clarity** — can you understand every word at 1x speed?
- **Naturalness** — does it sound like a real person or a robot?
- **Tone match** — does the energy level match your brand? (Healthcare needs calm; sales might want energetic)
- **Accent match** — if your customers are primarily from a specific region, a matching accent builds trust

**Pro tip:** Play three voice samples to a teammate and ask which sounds most like someone they'd trust to book an appointment. Let them pick.

### Disclosure Statement
By default, QuickVoice opens every call with a disclosure. You can customize this text, but you should always include one.

**Default:** "Hi, I'm [Agent Name], an AI assistant for [Company Name]. How can I help you today?"

**Medical:** "Hi, I'm Aria, an AI assistant for Bright Smile Dental. I can help you schedule appointments and answer questions about our services. How can I help you today?"

**Sales:** "Hi, I'm Jordan with Premier Homes. I'm an AI assistant, and I help connect you with our team. What can I do for you?"

---

## Step 4: Build Your Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is where you give your agent the information it needs to answer questions accurately.

### Add Your Business Basics

Fill in these fields:
- **Business name**
- **Business category** (healthcare, real estate, retail, etc.)
- **Address** (if location-based)
- **Hours of operation** (include holidays if relevant)
- **Phone number for transfers**
- **Website URL**

### Add Your FAQ

Click **+ Add FAQ** and enter each question-answer pair. Don't try to anticipate every possible wording — QuickVoice's AI understands that "What time do you close?" and "When do you shut down?" and "Are you open at 6pm?" all mean the same thing.

**Focus on:**
- The 5 most common reasons people call
- Your pricing structure
- Your policies (cancellations, refunds, returns)
- Your service area or locations
- Any certifications or compliance questions (HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.)

**Example FAQ entries:**

*Q: What are your hours?*
*A: We're open Monday through Friday, 8 AM to 6 PM Eastern. We're closed on weekends and major holidays. For urgent matters outside these hours, please visit our website or leave a voicemail and we'll call back first thing the next morning.*

*Q: How much does your service cost?*
*A: Our services start at $49 per month on our Starter plan, which includes up to 2,000 minutes of AI calls per month. We also have growth and enterprise plans. Would you like me to walk you through the options, or would you prefer to speak with someone from our team?*

### Upload Documents (Optional)

For more complex knowledge, you can upload:
- PDF product catalogs
- Service menus
- FAQ documents
- Policy documents

QuickVoice automatically extracts the relevant information and adds it to the agent's knowledge base.

---

## Step 5: Configure the Conversation Flow

This is where you define the logic of how the agent handles different types of calls.

### Call Opening
Choose how the agent opens every call. By default, it says your configured disclosure followed by "How can I help you today?" You can customize this further.

**For an appointment-focused business:**
> "Hi, I'm Aria with Bright Smile Dental. I can help you schedule or reschedule an appointment, answer questions about our services, or connect you with our team. How can I help you today?"

### Appointment Booking Flow (if applicable)
If you connected a calendar integration, enable **Appointment Booking**. Configure:
- Which calendars to check for availability
- How far in advance appointments can be booked (e.g., minimum 4 hours notice, maximum 60 days ahead)
- Appointment types and durations (15-min consultation, 60-min cleaning, 30-min fitting, etc.)
- Information to collect from the caller before confirming (name, phone, email, specific service needed)
- Confirmation message to read back before finalizing

### Escalation Rules
Define when the agent should transfer to a human. Click **+ Add Escalation Rule** for each scenario.

Common rules:
- **On request:** "If the caller asks to speak with a person or a manager, transfer immediately"
- **Billing escalation:** "If the caller mentions a billing dispute or incorrect charge, transfer to billing"
- **Emergency:** "If the caller describes a medical emergency, injury, or immediate danger, instruct them to call 911 and offer to stay on the line"
- **Unresolved after 3 attempts:** "If the agent cannot resolve the caller's issue after 3 attempts, offer to transfer"

### After-Hours Handling
Configure what happens when a call comes in outside business hours:
- Option A: AI agent handles it fully (takes messages, answers FAQs, handles emergencies)
- Option B: AI agent takes a message with callback promise
- Option C: AI agent plays a custom message and ends the call

Most businesses choose Option A — this is where AI agents deliver the most immediate value vs. voicemail.

---

## Step 6: Connect Integrations

### Google Calendar or Outlook
Click **Integrations → Calendar** and connect your Google or Microsoft account. Once connected, the agent can:
- Check real-time availability
- Create calendar events when booking
- Read existing appointments when callers want to reschedule

### HubSpot or Salesforce
Click **Integrations → CRM** and authenticate. Once connected, the agent can:
- Look up caller history by phone number
- Update contact records after each call
- Create new contacts for new callers
- Log call notes with disposition and summary

### Phone Number
Click **Integrations → Phone** and either:
- **Get a new number:** QuickVoice provides a local number for your area code instantly
- **Forward your existing number:** Keep your existing business number and forward calls to QuickVoice when lines are busy or after hours
- **Port your number:** Transfer your existing number to QuickVoice fully (takes 5–10 business days)

For testing, we recommend starting with a new QuickVoice number before porting your main line.

---

## Step 7: Test Your Agent

Before going live, test every scenario you care about.

### Use the Built-In Test Call
Click **Test Agent** in the dashboard. QuickVoice will call your mobile number and connect you to your AI agent in live mode.

Run through these scenarios:
1. **Standard inquiry:** "What are your hours?"
2. **Appointment request:** "I'd like to book an appointment"
3. **Unusual question:** Ask something not in your FAQ
4. **Transfer trigger:** "I'd like to speak with someone"
5. **After-hours scenario:** Check after-hours flow
6. **Rude or frustrated caller:** Say "This is ridiculous, I need to speak to a real person right now"

### What to Listen For
- Does the agent answer questions accurately and completely?
- Does the voice sound natural with appropriate pauses?
- Does it handle interruptions gracefully?
- Does escalation work correctly?
- Is the booking flow smooth (if applicable)?

### Adjust Based on Test Results
After testing, go back and update:
- Any FAQ answer that wasn't accurate
- Escalation rules that triggered too early or too late
- Voice or pacing if it felt off
- Opening statement if it felt too long or too short

Most setups take 1–2 rounds of testing before they're production-ready.

---

## Step 8: Go Live

When you're satisfied with testing, click **Activate Agent**.

From this moment:
- Every call to your assigned phone number is handled by your AI agent
- All call recordings and transcripts are saved to your dashboard
- Analytics begin tracking: call volume, resolution rate, escalation rate, average duration

**Congratulations — your AI voice agent is live.**

---

## Post-Launch: Your First Week Checklist

In the first week after launch, do these five things:

### Day 1–2: Monitor Call Recordings
Listen to the first 10–20 calls. You'll quickly spot:
- Questions the agent isn't answering well (add to FAQ)
- Unexpected caller needs you hadn't anticipated
- Any tone or pacing issues

### Day 3–4: Refine Your FAQ
Based on the calls you've listened to, update your FAQ to cover any gaps. This is the highest-leverage improvement activity in the first week.

### Day 5–7: Check Your Analytics Dashboard
Review:
- **Resolution rate** — what % of calls were handled fully by the agent (without transfer)?
- **Escalation rate** — what % were transferred to humans?
- **Abandonment rate** — what % hung up without completing an interaction?
- **Average call duration** — is it longer or shorter than expected?

If your resolution rate is below 60%, you likely have FAQ gaps. If it's above 85%, your agent is performing exceptionally.

---

## Advanced Configuration (After Week 1)

Once your basic agent is running well, explore these advanced features:

### Outbound Campaigns
Configure your agent to make outbound calls — appointment reminders, lead follow-up, customer check-ins. Set the call list, the script, the timing, and the volume, and QuickVoice handles the rest.

### Multi-Agent Architecture
For larger businesses, deploy specialized agents for different call types:
- **Inbound support agent** for existing customers
- **Lead qualification agent** for new inquiries
- **Appointment reminder agent** for outbound reminders
- **Collections agent** for payment follow-up

Each agent has a specialized script and knowledge base, which improves both accuracy and caller experience.

### Custom Voices (Voice Cloning)
On QuickVoice's higher-tier plans, you can clone a specific voice — either a custom voice actor or (with consent) a team member's voice. This creates a consistent brand voice across all calls.

### Sentiment-Based Escalation
Configure the agent to escalate calls when it detects high frustration or distress in the caller's voice, even if the caller hasn't explicitly asked for a human.

---

## Common Setup Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: FAQ Is Too Vague
Bad: *Q: What's your pricing? A: We have several plans.*
Good: *Q: What's your pricing? A: Our plans start at $49/month for up to 2,000 minutes. The Growth plan at $99/month gives you 5,000 minutes. For higher volumes, our Scale plan at $399/month includes 15,000 minutes. All plans include a free trial. Would you like me to help you figure out which plan fits your business?*

The more specific and complete your FAQ answers, the fewer transfers you'll have.

### Mistake 2: Setting Escalation Too Sensitive
If you route to a human for any ambiguous situation, you lose most of the efficiency gain. Trust the agent to handle a wider range of scenarios. Start with fewer escalation rules and add them only when you see the agent failing in specific, recurring ways.

### Mistake 3: Not Testing Edge Cases
Callers are creative. They'll ask questions you never anticipated. After testing the standard scenarios, deliberately try to confuse the agent: ask completely off-topic questions, try to book an appointment for a service you don't offer, call from a number that's not in your CRM. See how the agent handles it.

### Mistake 4: Setting the Voice Too Fast
Default speech rate for TTS is usually appropriate. But if your business serves older customers or customers for whom English is a second language, consider slowing the speech rate by 10–15%. It dramatically improves comprehension without feeling condescending.

### Mistake 5: Forgetting After-Hours Configuration
The highest-value use case for most SMBs is after-hours call handling. If you don't configure after-hours behavior, the agent handles calls the same way 24/7 — which might not be appropriate (e.g., it shouldn't try to book dental appointments at 2 AM without noting that it will be confirmed during business hours).

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need a phone number from QuickVoice, or can I use my existing number?**
You can use either. QuickVoice provides instant local numbers or toll-free numbers. Alternatively, forward your existing business number to QuickVoice (calls ring on your old number and QuickVoice intercepts). You can also port your number to QuickVoice fully (takes 5–10 business days but gives the cleanest setup).

**Can the AI agent handle multiple calls simultaneously?**
Yes. QuickVoice handles unlimited concurrent calls — your AI agent can have 1 call or 1,000 calls happening simultaneously with no quality degradation. This is a significant advantage over human staffing.

**What happens to voicemails or missed calls from before I set up QuickVoice?**
QuickVoice only handles new calls from the moment you activate. Any voicemails on your previous system remain there.

**Can I pause the agent and re-enable it?**
Yes. You can pause any agent from the dashboard instantly. Paused agents don't accept calls and don't count against your minutes.

**What if I want to change the script later?**
You can edit any part of the agent configuration at any time — FAQ, persona, escalation rules, conversation flow — from the dashboard. Changes take effect within 60 seconds.

**Is there a limit to how many agents I can create?**
This depends on your plan. Starter plans include 1–2 agents. Growth and Scale plans allow multiple specialized agents.

## Before You Start: Three Things to Prepare

Before logging into QuickVoice, take 5 minutes to collect these items. Having them ready will make the setup go faster.

### 1. Your Business FAQ (10–20 questions)

Write down the 10–20 questions you hear most from callers. For example:
- What are your business hours?
- Where are you located?
- How much does [service/product] cost?
- Do you accept [insurance/credit cards]?
- How do I reschedule my appointment?

You don't need to write perfect answers yet. Rough notes are fine — you'll refine them during setup.

### 2. Your Escalation Rules

Decide: what types of calls should the AI handle, and what should be transferred to a human? Be specific.

Examples:
- Handle: general questions, appointment booking, basic support
- Transfer to human: billing disputes, complaints, calls about specific patient names, anything the AI can't resolve

### 3. Your Calendar or CRM Login

If you want the agent to book appointments or look up customer records, have your Google Calendar, HubSpot, Salesforce, or scheduling system login ready.

---

## Step 1: Create Your QuickVoice Account

Go to [quickvoice.co](https://quickvoice.co) and click **Start Free Trial**. Enter your email and create a password. No credit card is required for the trial.

After signing up, you'll land on the **Agent Dashboard** — the central hub for building and managing your AI voice agents.

---

## Step 2: Create a New Agent

Click **+ New Agent** in the top right corner of the dashboard.

You'll see a setup wizard that walks you through four sections:

1. **Agent Profile** — name, persona, voice
2. **Knowledge Base** — what the agent knows
3. **Conversation Flow** — how the agent handles different scenarios
4. **Integrations** — what systems the agent connects to

Let's go through each one.

---

## Step 3: Configure Your Agent Profile

### Agent Name
Give your agent a human name. Customers respond better to named agents than to "our AI system."

Good examples: *Aria*, *Jordan*, *Alex*, *Sam*, *Morgan*

Avoid: *Bot*, *AI Assistant*, *System*, *Operator*

### Agent Persona
Write 2–3 sentences describing who this agent is. This becomes part of the agent's system prompt.

**Example for a dental practice:**
> "You are Aria, the patient care coordinator for Bright Smile Dental. You are warm, professional, and patient. You help patients schedule appointments, answer questions about our services, and handle any concerns they have about their care."

**Example for a real estate team:**
> "You are Jordan, a licensed assistant for the Premier Homes team. You are knowledgeable about real estate in the Greater Boston area, friendly but professional, and focused on connecting serious buyers and sellers with our agents."

### Voice Selection
QuickVoice offers 40+ voices across genders, ages, accents, and styles. Preview each voice before selecting. Pay attention to:

- **Clarity** — can you understand every word at 1x speed?
- **Naturalness** — does it sound like a real person or a robot?
- **Tone match** — does the energy level match your brand? (Healthcare needs calm; sales might want energetic)
- **Accent match** — if your customers are primarily from a specific region, a matching accent builds trust

**Pro tip:** Play three voice samples to a teammate and ask which sounds most like someone they'd trust to book an appointment. Let them pick.

### Disclosure Statement
By default, QuickVoice opens every call with a disclosure. You can customize this text, but you should always include one.

**Default:** "Hi, I'm [Agent Name], an AI assistant for [Company Name]. How can I help you today?"

**Medical:** "Hi, I'm Aria, an AI assistant for Bright Smile Dental. I can help you schedule appointments and answer questions about our services. How can I help you today?"

**Sales:** "Hi, I'm Jordan with Premier Homes. I'm an AI assistant, and I help connect you with our team. What can I do for you?"

---

## Step 4: Build Your Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is where you give your agent the information it needs to answer questions accurately.

### Add Your Business Basics

Fill in these fields:
- **Business name**
- **Business category** (healthcare, real estate, retail, etc.)
- **Address** (if location-based)
- **Hours of operation** (include holidays if relevant)
- **Phone number for transfers**
- **Website URL**

### Add Your FAQ

Click **+ Add FAQ** and enter each question-answer pair. Don't try to anticipate every possible wording — QuickVoice's AI understands that "What time do you close?" and "When do you shut down?" and "Are you open at 6pm?" all mean the same thing.

**Focus on:**
- The 5 most common reasons people call
- Your pricing structure
- Your policies (cancellations, refunds, returns)
- Your service area or locations
- Any certifications or compliance questions (HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.)

**Example FAQ entries:**

*Q: What are your hours?*
*A: We're open Monday through Friday, 8 AM to 6 PM Eastern. We're closed on weekends and major holidays. For urgent matters outside these hours, please visit our website or leave a voicemail and we'll call back first thing the next morning.*

*Q: How much does your service cost?*
*A: Our services start at $49 per month on our Starter plan, which includes up to 2,000 minutes of AI calls per month. We also have growth and enterprise plans. Would you like me to walk you through the options, or would you prefer to speak with someone from our team?*

### Upload Documents (Optional)

For more complex knowledge, you can upload:
- PDF product catalogs
- Service menus
- FAQ documents
- Policy documents

QuickVoice automatically extracts the relevant information and adds it to the agent's knowledge base.

---

## Step 5: Configure the Conversation Flow

This is where you define the logic of how the agent handles different types of calls.

### Call Opening
Choose how the agent opens every call. By default, it says your configured disclosure followed by "How can I help you today?" You can customize this further.

**For an appointment-focused business:**
> "Hi, I'm Aria with Bright Smile Dental. I can help you schedule or reschedule an appointment, answer questions about our services, or connect you with our team. How can I help you today?"

### Appointment Booking Flow (if applicable)
If you connected a calendar integration, enable **Appointment Booking**. Configure:
- Which calendars to check for availability
- How far in advance appointments can be booked (e.g., minimum 4 hours notice, maximum 60 days ahead)
- Appointment types and durations (15-min consultation, 60-min cleaning, 30-min fitting, etc.)
- Information to collect from the caller before confirming (name, phone, email, specific service needed)
- Confirmation message to read back before finalizing

### Escalation Rules
Define when the agent should transfer to a human. Click **+ Add Escalation Rule** for each scenario.

Common rules:
- **On request:** "If the caller asks to speak with a person or a manager, transfer immediately"
- **Billing escalation:** "If the caller mentions a billing dispute or incorrect charge, transfer to billing"
- **Emergency:** "If the caller describes a medical emergency, injury, or immediate danger, instruct them to call 911 and offer to stay on the line"
- **Unresolved after 3 attempts:** "If the agent cannot resolve the caller's issue after 3 attempts, offer to transfer"

### After-Hours Handling
Configure what happens when a call comes in outside business hours:
- Option A: AI agent handles it fully (takes messages, answers FAQs, handles emergencies)
- Option B: AI agent takes a message with callback promise
- Option C: AI agent plays a custom message and ends the call

Most businesses choose Option A — this is where AI agents deliver the most immediate value vs. voicemail.

---

## Step 6: Connect Integrations

### Google Calendar or Outlook
Click **Integrations → Calendar** and connect your Google or Microsoft account. Once connected, the agent can:
- Check real-time availability
- Create calendar events when booking
- Read existing appointments when callers want to reschedule

### HubSpot or Salesforce
Click **Integrations → CRM** and authenticate. Once connected, the agent can:
- Look up caller history by phone number
- Update contact records after each call
- Create new contacts for new callers
- Log call notes with disposition and summary

### Phone Number
Click **Integrations → Phone** and either:
- **Get a new number:** QuickVoice provides a local number for your area code instantly
- **Forward your existing number:** Keep your existing business number and forward calls to QuickVoice when lines are busy or after hours
- **Port your number:** Transfer your existing number to QuickVoice fully (takes 5–10 business days)

For testing, we recommend starting with a new QuickVoice number before porting your main line.

---

## Step 7: Test Your Agent

Before going live, test every scenario you care about.

### Use the Built-In Test Call
Click **Test Agent** in the dashboard. QuickVoice will call your mobile number and connect you to your AI agent in live mode.

Run through these scenarios:
1. **Standard inquiry:** "What are your hours?"
2. **Appointment request:** "I'd like to book an appointment"
3. **Unusual question:** Ask something not in your FAQ
4. **Transfer trigger:** "I'd like to speak with someone"
5. **After-hours scenario:** Check after-hours flow
6. **Rude or frustrated caller:** Say "This is ridiculous, I need to speak to a real person right now"

### What to Listen For
- Does the agent answer questions accurately and completely?
- Does the voice sound natural with appropriate pauses?
- Does it handle interruptions gracefully?
- Does escalation work correctly?
- Is the booking flow smooth (if applicable)?

### Adjust Based on Test Results

Most setups take 1–2 rounds of testing before they're production-ready.

---

## Step 8: Go Live

When you're satisfied with testing, click **Activate Agent**.

From this moment:
- Every call to your assigned phone number is handled by your AI agent
- All call recordings and transcripts are saved to your dashboard
- Analytics begin tracking: call volume, resolution rate, escalation rate, average duration

**Congratulations — your AI voice agent is live.**

---

## Post-Launch: Your First Week Checklist

In the first week after launch, do these five things:

### Day 1–2: Monitor Call Recordings
Listen to the first 10–20 calls. You'll quickly spot:
- Questions the agent isn't answering well (add to FAQ)
- Unexpected caller needs you hadn't anticipated
- Any tone or pacing issues

### Day 3–4: Refine Your FAQ
Based on the calls you've listened to, update your FAQ to cover any gaps. This is the highest-leverage improvement activity in the first week.

### Day 5–7: Check Your Analytics Dashboard
Review:
- **Resolution rate** — what % of calls were handled fully by the agent (without transfer)?
- **Escalation rate** — what % were transferred to humans?
- **Abandonment rate** — what % hung up without completing an interaction?
- **Average call duration** — is it longer or shorter than expected?

If your resolution rate is below 60%, you likely have FAQ gaps. If it's above 85%, your agent is performing exceptionally.

## Advanced Configuration (After Week 1)

Once your basic agent is running well, explore these advanced features:

### Outbound Campaigns
Configure your agent to make outbound calls — appointment reminders, lead follow-up, customer check-ins. Set the call list, the script, the timing, and the volume, and QuickVoice handles the rest.

### Multi-Agent Architecture
For larger businesses, deploy specialized agents for different call types:
- **Inbound support agent** for existing customers
- **Lead qualification agent** for new inquiries
- **Appointment reminder agent** for outbound reminders
- **Collections agent** for payment follow-up

Each agent has a specialized script and knowledge base, which improves both accuracy and caller experience.

### Custom Voices (Voice Cloning)
On QuickVoice's higher-tier plans, you can clone a specific voice — either a custom voice actor or (with consent) a team member's voice. This creates a consistent brand voice across all calls.

### Sentiment-Based Escalation
Configure the agent to escalate calls when it detects high frustration or distress in the caller's voice, even if the caller hasn't explicitly asked for a human.

## Common Setup Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: FAQ Is Too Vague
Bad: *Q: What's your pricing? A: We have several plans.*
Good: *Q: What's your pricing? A: Our plans start at $49/month for up to 2,000 minutes. The Growth plan at $99/month gives you 5,000 minutes. For higher volumes, our Scale plan at $399/month includes 15,000 minutes. All plans include a free trial. Would you like me to help you figure out which plan fits your business?*

The more specific and complete your FAQ answers, the fewer transfers you'll have.

### Mistake 2: Setting Escalation Too Sensitive
If you route to a human for any ambiguous situation, you lose most of the efficiency gain. Trust the agent to handle a wider range of scenarios. Start with fewer escalation rules and add them only when you see the agent failing in specific, recurring ways.

### Mistake 3: Not Testing Edge Cases
Callers are creative. They'll ask questions you never anticipated. After testing the standard scenarios, deliberately try to confuse the agent: ask completely off-topic questions, try to book an appointment for a service you don't offer, call from a number that's not in your CRM. See how the agent handles it.

### Mistake 4: Setting the Voice Too Fast
Default speech rate for TTS is usually appropriate. But if your business serves older customers or customers for whom English is a second language, consider slowing the speech rate by 10–15%. It dramatically improves comprehension without feeling condescending.

### Mistake 5: Forgetting After-Hours Configuration
The highest-value use case for most SMBs is after-hours call handling. If you don't configure after-hours behavior, the agent handles calls the same way 24/7 — which might not be appropriate (e.g., it shouldn't try to book dental appointments at 2 AM without noting that it will be confirmed during business hours).

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need a phone number from QuickVoice, or can I use my existing number?**
You can use either. QuickVoice provides instant local numbers or toll-free numbers. Alternatively, forward your existing business number to QuickVoice (calls ring on your old number and QuickVoice intercepts). You can also port your number to QuickVoice fully (takes 5–10 business days but gives the cleanest setup).

**Can the AI agent handle multiple calls simultaneously?**
Yes. QuickVoice handles unlimited concurrent calls — your AI agent can have 1 call or 1,000 calls happening simultaneously with no quality degradation. This is a significant advantage over human staffing.

**What happens to voicemails or missed calls from before I set up QuickVoice?**
QuickVoice only handles new calls from the moment you activate. Any voicemails on your previous system remain there.

**Can I pause the agent and re-enable it?**
Yes. You can pause any agent from the dashboard instantly. Paused agents don't accept calls and don't count against your minutes.

**What if I want to change the script later?**
You can edit any part of the agent configuration at any time — FAQ, persona, escalation rules, conversation flow — from the dashboard. Changes take effect within 60 seconds.

**Is there a limit to how many agents I can create?**
This depends on your plan. Starter plans include 1–2 agents. Growth and Scale plans allow multiple specialized agents.
