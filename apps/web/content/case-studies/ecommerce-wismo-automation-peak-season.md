# DTC Brand Handles 91% of Black Friday Call Volume with AI — Zero Seasonal Hires

**How a $30M apparel brand eliminated seasonal hiring chaos, cut WISMO calls by 86%, and delivered its highest-ever customer satisfaction scores during the busiest shopping weekend of the year.**

---

## Company Profile

This direct-to-consumer apparel brand has built a loyal following around premium basics and limited-edition seasonal drops. Founded in 2017, the company has grown steadily to $30 million in annual revenue with a lean team of 65 full-time employees. The brand fulfills more than 15,000 orders per month during standard periods, with volume surging past 50,000 orders per month during Q4 — driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday (BFCM) promotions, holiday gifting, and winter product launches.

The company operates exclusively online through a Shopify Plus storefront, with fulfillment managed through a combination of in-house warehousing and a 3PL partner. Shipping logistics are coordinated through ShipStation, with carriers including USPS, UPS, and FedEx depending on package weight and destination. The customer support team consists of 8 full-time agents who handle phone, email, and live chat inquiries year-round.

---

## The Challenge

Every Q4 brought the same painful cycle. As order volume tripled, the support team was overwhelmed by a tsunami of "Where Is My Order?" (WISMO) calls. These calls — customers asking for tracking updates, delivery estimates, and shipment confirmations — accounted for 42% of all inbound support contacts during peak season.

To cope, the brand hired 12 seasonal temporary representatives every year. The onboarding process consumed two full weeks of training, during which existing agents had to split their time between handling live customers and coaching new hires. Even after training, seasonal reps lacked the product knowledge and system fluency of permanent staff, leading to longer call times and inconsistent answers.

The consequences were measurable and severe:

- **Average handle time ballooned** from 4.5 minutes in off-peak months to 6.2 minutes during Q4.
- **Customer satisfaction (CSAT) dropped** from 4.1/5.0 to 3.6/5.0 during BFCM week.
- **Cost per support contact spiked** to $9.50, factoring in seasonal hiring, training, overtime, and technology licenses.
- **Agent burnout was rampant.** Two full-time agents quit after the previous BFCM, citing workload stress.

> "Every year we told ourselves it would be different. We'd start training earlier, hire more people, build better macros. But the fundamental problem was that we were throwing human labor at a repetitive information-retrieval task. It was never going to scale."
>
> — **VP of Customer Experience**

The leadership team calculated that WISMO-related support costs exceeded $546,000 annually when accounting for seasonal labor, agent overtime, technology overhead, and the downstream revenue impact of poor CSAT scores. They needed a solution that could absorb unpredictable volume spikes without degrading the customer experience.

---

## Why QuickVoice

The brand evaluated three categories of solutions: expanding the permanent support team, outsourcing to a BPO, and deploying AI-powered voice automation. They chose QuickVoice for several critical reasons:

1. **Native Shopify Plus integration.** QuickVoice connects directly to the Shopify Plus Admin and Storefront APIs, meaning it can pull real-time order data — line items, fulfillment status, tracking numbers, estimated delivery dates — without any middleware or custom development.

2. **ShipStation carrier data access.** Beyond Shopify's native fulfillment data, QuickVoice integrates with ShipStation to surface granular carrier-level tracking, including scan events, exception flags, and delivery confirmation timestamps.

3. **Proactive outbound capability.** Rather than waiting for customers to call in, QuickVoice can proactively reach out via voice call or SMS when shipment exceptions occur — such as weather delays, address issues, or carrier holds.

4. **Elastic scalability.** The AI handles 10 concurrent calls or 10,000 concurrent calls with identical response quality. There is no training ramp, no scheduling, and no overtime.

5. **Conversational natural language.** Customers speak naturally — "I ordered some stuff on Friday, where is it?" — and QuickVoice resolves their identity, locates the order, and provides a clear answer without rigid IVR menus.

> "We didn't want a glorified phone tree. We wanted something that could actually have a conversation with our customers and give them a real answer in 90 seconds or less."
>
> — **Director of Operations**

---

## The Solution

QuickVoice was configured to handle the complete WISMO lifecycle across inbound and outbound channels:

### Inbound WISMO Resolution

When a customer calls, QuickVoice identifies them through caller ID match against the Shopify customer database or by asking for an order number or email address. Once authenticated, the AI:

- Retrieves all open orders and their fulfillment status from Shopify Plus.
- Pulls the latest carrier tracking data from ShipStation, including the most recent scan location, estimated delivery window, and any exception flags.
- Communicates the status in plain language: "Your order shipped on Tuesday via UPS Ground. It was scanned in Memphis this morning and is scheduled to arrive by Thursday."
- Offers to send a tracking link via SMS for the customer to follow along in real time.
- If the package is delayed or shows an exception, explains the situation and offers to connect the customer with a human agent or set up a proactive callback when the status changes.

### Proactive Outbound Updates

QuickVoice monitors ShipStation for shipment exceptions — packages stuck in transit for more than 48 hours, failed delivery attempts, or address correction holds. When an exception is detected, the AI initiates an outbound call or SMS to the customer, providing a transparent update and next steps before the customer ever picks up the phone to complain.

### SMS Tracking Links

Every interaction, whether inbound or outbound, includes an option to send a branded SMS with a direct tracking link. This self-service touchpoint reduced repeat WISMO calls by giving customers an easy way to check status on their own.

### Intelligent Escalation

For issues that require human intervention — lost packages, damaged items, refund requests — QuickVoice routes the call to a live agent with full context: customer name, order details, tracking history, and the reason for escalation. The agent picks up the conversation without asking the customer to repeat anything.

---

## Implementation

The rollout followed a phased approach designed to minimize risk heading into the critical Q4 selling season:

**Week 1–2: Integration and Configuration**
The engineering team connected QuickVoice to Shopify Plus and ShipStation using pre-built connectors. Custom logic was added for the brand's specific carrier selection rules and fulfillment timelines. Call scripts were drafted in collaboration with the support team lead to match the brand's voice and tone.

**Week 3: Internal Testing**
The support team ran simulated calls covering 40+ WISMO scenarios, including multi-item orders, split shipments, international tracking, and carrier exceptions. Edge cases were identified and addressed, including orders fulfilled through the 3PL partner that had different tracking data structures.

**Week 4: Controlled Launch (15% of Inbound Volume)**
QuickVoice was introduced to a randomized 15% of inbound callers. The team monitored containment rate, call duration, CSAT scores, and escalation reasons in real time. Initial containment was 78%, which improved to 84% after script refinements.

**Week 5–6: Full Deployment and BFCM Preparation**
The system was expanded to 100% of inbound WISMO calls. Proactive outbound calling was activated. Load testing confirmed the system could handle 5x normal call volume without degradation.

**BFCM Week: Live at Full Scale**
QuickVoice handled its first Black Friday with zero seasonal hires on the support team.

---

## Results

The impact was immediate and dramatic. The following table compares key metrics from the prior year's Q4 (with 12 seasonal hires) to the first Q4 with QuickVoice:

| Metric | Before QuickVoice | After QuickVoice | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| WISMO calls (% of support volume) | 42% | 6% | **-86%** |
| Peak season calls handled by AI | 0% | 91% | **+91 pts** |
| Seasonal hires needed | 12 temps | 0 | **-100%** |
| Average handle time | 6.2 min | 1.8 min | **-71%** |
| Cost per support contact | $9.50 | $0.85 | **-91%** |
| Annual support savings | — | $546,000 | — |
| CSAT during peak season | 3.6 / 5.0 | 4.3 / 5.0 | **+19%** |

### Deeper Impact

Beyond the headline metrics, several secondary benefits emerged:

- **Agent morale improved significantly.** With WISMO calls removed from their queue, the permanent support team focused on complex issues — product questions, styling advice, VIP customer outreach — that were more engaging and impactful.
- **No post-BFCM attrition.** For the first time in three years, zero agents resigned in Q1 following the holiday season.
- **Proactive outbound calls reduced inbound volume further.** By contacting customers about shipping delays before they called in, the brand intercepted an estimated 2,800 calls during BFCM week alone.
- **SMS tracking links had a 68% click-through rate,** creating a self-service loop that prevented repeat calls.

> "On Black Friday, our AI handled over 3,200 calls. Our human team handled 310. And our CSAT was the highest it's ever been in any quarter, let alone during peak. I had to double-check the numbers because I didn't believe them."
>
> — **VP of Customer Experience**

---

## What's Next

Following the success of WISMO automation, the brand is expanding QuickVoice into three additional use cases:

1. **Post-purchase review collection.** AI calls customers 5 days after delivery to check satisfaction and request a product review, with an SMS link to the review form.

2. **Proactive reorder reminders.** For consumable products (basics packs, underwear subscriptions), QuickVoice will call customers at predicted replenishment intervals to offer easy reordering.

3. **Returns initiation.** Customers will be able to start a return or exchange via a voice call, with QuickVoice handling eligibility checks, reason capture, and label generation.

The long-term vision is to make QuickVoice the first touchpoint for every post-purchase interaction, reserving human agents for high-value consultative conversations and escalations.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **WISMO is the single largest driver of support volume for most e-commerce brands.** Automating it with AI delivers outsized ROI because the calls are high-volume, low-complexity, and data-driven.

- **Seasonal hiring is not a scalable strategy.** Training costs, inconsistent quality, and agent burnout create a compounding problem every year. AI absorbs volume spikes without any of these liabilities.

- **Proactive outbound communication reduces inbound volume.** Reaching customers before they call transforms a reactive cost center into a proactive experience differentiator.

- **Integration depth matters.** QuickVoice's native connections to Shopify Plus and ShipStation meant the AI could answer questions with the same accuracy as the best human agents — because it accessed the same data in real time.

- **CSAT improves when customers get fast, accurate answers.** The 19% CSAT improvement was not despite using AI — it was because of it. Customers do not want to wait on hold for 8 minutes. They want their tracking number in 90 seconds.

> "We went from dreading Q4 to looking forward to it. That's probably the most meaningful thing I can say about what QuickVoice did for our team."
