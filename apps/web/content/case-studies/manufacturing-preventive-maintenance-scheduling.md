# Electronics Manufacturer Reduces Unplanned Downtime 41% with AI Maintenance Coordination

Preventive maintenance is the backbone of manufacturing reliability, but only when it actually gets done. For an electronics contract manufacturer on the West Coast, the preventive maintenance program existed on paper — meticulously planned in their CMMS, with schedules, procedures, and parts lists all properly documented. The problem was execution. PM tasks were assigned through email notifications that maintenance technicians rarely saw, vendor service calls required days of back-and-forth scheduling, and overdue work orders accumulated silently until a machine broke down and brought a production line to a halt. This is the story of how QuickVoice AI voice agents closed the gap between planned maintenance and executed maintenance, reducing unplanned downtime by 41% and delivering $298,000 in annual savings.

---

## 1. Company Profile

| Detail | Description |
|---|---|
| **Company Type** | Electronics contract manufacturer (PCB assembly, box build, test) |
| **Employees** | 320 (maintenance, production, engineering, and administration) |
| **Facility** | Single 185,000 sq ft manufacturing facility, West Coast |
| **Production Assets** | 180 tracked assets (SMT lines, wave solder, selective solder, AOI, ICT, functional test, environmental chambers) |
| **CMMS** | IBM Maximo |
| **Key Certifications** | ISO 13485 (medical devices), ISO 9001, IPC-A-610 Class 3 |
| **Maintenance Team** | 14 maintenance technicians, 3 maintenance leads, 1 maintenance manager |
| **Vendor Service Contracts** | 22 active contracts with OEM equipment vendors |

The company served customers in medical devices, aerospace, and industrial instrumentation — industries where product reliability is non-negotiable and manufacturing process control is subject to regulatory audit. Their ISO 13485 certification required documented evidence that preventive maintenance was performed on schedule, that calibrated equipment was within certification windows, and that any deviation was formally investigated and corrected. A missed PM was not just an operational risk; it was a compliance risk that could jeopardize their certification and their ability to serve their most important customers.

The maintenance organization was structured around three shifts, with 4 to 5 technicians per shift and a maintenance lead overseeing each. The maintenance manager, Linda Nguyen, was responsible for PM program compliance, vendor management, and maintenance budgeting. She had 18 years of experience in manufacturing maintenance and had implemented the Maximo CMMS five years earlier. The system was well-configured, with detailed PM schedules for all 180 assets, complete with task lists, estimated durations, required parts, and safety procedures. The data infrastructure was solid. The human execution layer was the failure point.

## 2. The Challenge

Linda had been fighting the PM compliance battle for years. The metrics told a frustrating story: a well-designed maintenance program that was consistently undermined by communication failures.

### PM Compliance Was Stuck at 72%

Despite having a comprehensive PM schedule in Maximo, the facility's PM compliance rate — the percentage of preventive maintenance work orders completed on or before their due date — had plateaued at 72% for over two years. Nearly one in three scheduled PMs was completed late or not at all. The root cause was not a lack of planning or resources; it was a notification problem.

When Maximo generated a PM work order, the system sent an email notification to the assigned maintenance technician. The problem was that maintenance technicians spent their days on the production floor, not at computers. Most checked email once a day at best, and many checked it only when a supervisor specifically told them to. Email notifications for PM tasks sat unread in inboxes for days. By the time a technician saw the notification, the PM was often already overdue, and the production schedule had moved on to fill the maintenance window with production runs.

### Overdue PMs Were Invisible Until Audit Time

The maintenance leads were responsible for tracking PM completion, but their visibility was limited. Maximo generated weekly compliance reports, but these were backward-looking — they told you what was already late, not what was about to become late. Leads had to manually query the system to identify upcoming PMs and then physically find technicians on the floor to assign the work. This manual tracking process consumed roughly 6 hours per week per lead, and it was inherently reactive.

The invisibility of overdue PMs became acutely painful during ISO audits. In the most recent ISO 13485 surveillance audit, the auditor flagged 11 overdue PM work orders on equipment used in medical device production. The finding resulted in a minor non-conformance that required a formal corrective action response and a follow-up audit — a process that consumed 80+ hours of management time and created anxiety throughout the organization.

### Vendor Service Scheduling Was Painfully Slow

Twenty-two production assets required periodic service by OEM vendor technicians — specialized equipment like SMT placement machines, AOI systems, and environmental test chambers that the in-house team was not qualified to maintain. Scheduling these vendor visits required back-and-forth phone calls and emails between the maintenance leads and the vendor's service dispatch. On average, it took 2.8 days from the time a vendor service request was initiated to the time a technician was confirmed and scheduled. During that 2.8-day gap, the equipment either ran without the required maintenance (a compliance risk) or sat idle (a production capacity loss).

### Unplanned Downtime Was Costing $24,000 Per Month

The direct consequence of missed PMs was equipment failure. Assets that did not receive scheduled maintenance broke down more often, and those breakdowns happened at the worst possible times — in the middle of production runs with customer delivery deadlines. The facility averaged 34 hours of unplanned downtime per month, costing approximately $24,000 per month in lost production, emergency repair costs, overtime labor for recovery, and expedited shipping to meet customer commitments.

> "We had the best-designed PM program I have ever built. Every asset had a detailed schedule, every task had a procedure, every part was stocked. And we were still only hitting 72% compliance because we could not get the information from the computer screen to the technician on the floor. It was the most basic communication failure imaginable, and it was costing us a fortune."
> — Linda Nguyen, Maintenance Manager

## 3. Why QuickVoice

Linda evaluated three approaches: hiring a dedicated PM coordinator, implementing a mobile CMMS app, and deploying QuickVoice AI voice agents. The mobile app was piloted for 60 days but adoption was poor — technicians found the interface cumbersome in a shop floor environment where they wore gloves and moved between work areas constantly. The dedicated coordinator would have cost $75,000 per year and still would have relied on finding technicians and communicating verbally. QuickVoice offered a compelling alternative for four reasons.

**Voice Notifications Cut Through Shop Floor Noise.** Unlike emails that sat unread or mobile app alerts that were ignored, a phone call to a technician's mobile or the shop floor phone demanded immediate attention. QuickVoice could deliver PM assignments directly to maintenance personnel via voice, ensuring the information reached them in real time rather than waiting for them to check a screen.

**IBM Maximo Native Integration.** QuickVoice connected directly to Maximo's work order management module via API. The AI agent could pull upcoming PM work orders, assigned technicians, task details, and due dates in real time. When a technician confirmed completion of a PM task via a return call, the work order status was updated in Maximo automatically, eliminating manual data entry.

**Vendor Service Auto-Scheduling.** QuickVoice could initiate outbound calls to vendor service dispatch centers, communicate the required service details (equipment model, serial number, service type, preferred dates), and negotiate a confirmed appointment without any human involvement. The entire vendor scheduling process was compressed from 2.8 days of back-and-forth to a single automated interaction.

**Escalation Logic for Overdue Work Orders.** QuickVoice implemented a tiered escalation protocol: if a PM was not confirmed as complete within 24 hours of its due date, the system called the maintenance lead. If still incomplete at 48 hours, the plant manager received a call. This created automatic accountability that had not existed before.

> "I needed a solution that worked in the real world of a manufacturing floor, not in the ideal world of a software demo. Technicians are covered in flux residue, wearing nitrile gloves, and moving between 15 machines in an 8-hour shift. They are not going to stop and check an app. But they will answer their phone."
> — Linda Nguyen, Maintenance Manager

---

## 4. The Solution

QuickVoice deployed three interconnected capabilities: PM notification and completion tracking, vendor service auto-scheduling, and compliance escalation management.

### PM Notification and Completion Tracking

Three days before a PM work order's due date, QuickVoice placed a voice call to the assigned maintenance technician. The AI agent communicated the specific asset, PM task description, estimated duration, any required parts (confirming availability in the storeroom based on Maximo inventory data), and the due date. The technician could acknowledge the task and indicate a planned completion time, or flag a scheduling conflict that needed to be resolved with the maintenance lead.

On the due date, if the work order had not been marked complete in Maximo, QuickVoice placed a follow-up call to the technician. This call served as both a reminder and a completion capture mechanism — the technician could verbally confirm that the PM was done, and the AI agent would update the work order status in Maximo, record the completion time, and note any observations the technician wanted to log (abnormal wear, parts replaced, recommended follow-up).

For PMs that required production equipment to be taken offline, QuickVoice coordinated with production supervisors by calling them 48 hours in advance to negotiate a maintenance window that minimized production disruption. This scheduling negotiation, which previously happened informally and often fell through, was now formalized and tracked.

### Vendor Service Auto-Scheduling

When Maximo generated a work order requiring vendor service, QuickVoice initiated the vendor scheduling process within 2 hours. The AI agent called the vendor's service dispatch number, provided the equipment details and required service type, and requested available dates within the next 5 business days. The agent could negotiate between multiple available slots, selecting the option that best aligned with the facility's production schedule (which it accessed in real time from the manufacturing execution system).

Once a date and time were confirmed, the appointment was written back to Maximo as a scheduled work order, and notification calls were placed to the maintenance lead and the production supervisor for the affected area. If the vendor's earliest availability fell outside the 5-day window, the system flagged it as a potential compliance risk and escalated to the maintenance manager.

### Compliance Escalation Management

QuickVoice implemented a three-tier escalation protocol for overdue PMs:

- **Tier 1 (Due date +24 hours):** Automatic call to the assigned maintenance lead with the overdue work order details and a request to intervene.
- **Tier 2 (Due date +48 hours):** Automatic call to the maintenance manager (Linda) with a summary of all overdue PMs and their assigned technicians.
- **Tier 3 (Due date +72 hours):** Automatic call to the plant manager, signaling a systemic compliance risk requiring executive attention.

For ISO 13485-critical assets (those used in medical device production), the escalation timeline was compressed: Tier 1 at +12 hours, Tier 2 at +24 hours, Tier 3 at +48 hours.

---

## 5. Implementation

The full deployment took four weeks from contract signing to production go-live.

### Week 1: Maximo Integration and Asset Mapping

The QuickVoice engineering team established the API connection with the facility's IBM Maximo instance. All 180 tracked assets were mapped, along with their PM schedules, assigned technicians, criticality classifications, and vendor service requirements. The 22 vendor service contracts were cataloged with dispatch phone numbers, service request protocols, and typical response time benchmarks. Data security protocols were validated, and access was restricted to work order and asset data only — no financial or HR data.

### Week 2: Call Script Development and Workflow Configuration

Call scripts were developed for eight scenarios: PM advance notification, PM due-date reminder, PM completion confirmation, production window negotiation, vendor service scheduling, overdue PM escalation (three tiers), and vendor delay notification. Linda and her three maintenance leads reviewed every script for technical accuracy, ensuring that the AI agent used the correct maintenance terminology and referenced the right asset identifiers. The escalation timelines and criticality-based rules were configured and tested with simulated overdue work orders.

### Week 3: Pilot on High-Criticality Assets

The system went live for the 45 highest-criticality assets — those used in medical device and aerospace production — where PM compliance had the greatest regulatory and financial impact. Maintenance leads monitored every AI interaction for the first five days, comparing the voice notification process against the old email-based workflow. The results were immediately evident: PM acknowledgment rates jumped from roughly 30% within 24 hours (email) to 88% within 4 hours (voice). Three vendor service appointments that would have taken days to schedule were confirmed within 3 hours.

### Week 4: Full Rollout and Team Training

The system was expanded to all 180 assets. All 14 maintenance technicians, 3 leads, and the maintenance manager received 60 minutes of training on how to interact with the AI agent (confirming completions, flagging conflicts, reporting abnormal findings) and how to use the QuickVoice dashboard to monitor PM status across the facility. Production supervisors received a separate 30-minute briefing on the automated maintenance window negotiation process and how to respond to scheduling calls from the AI agent.

---

## 6. Results

After 90 days of full operation, Linda and the plant leadership team reviewed performance data. The results confirmed that the communication gap between the CMMS and the shop floor had been effectively closed.

| Metric | Before QuickVoice | After QuickVoice | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PM compliance rate** | 72% | 96% | **+33 percentage points** |
| **Unplanned downtime** | 34 hrs/month | 20 hrs/month | **-41%** |
| **Vendor technician response** | 2.8 days | 1.1 days | **-61%** |
| **Maintenance cost per asset** | $4,200/year | $3,100/year | **-26%** |
| **PM acknowledgment (within 4 hrs)** | ~30% (email) | 88% (voice) | **+193%** |
| **Overdue PMs at any given time** | 18-24 work orders | 3-5 work orders | **-78%** |
| **Annual savings** | — | $298,000 | — |

### Breaking Down the $298,000 in Annual Savings

The savings came from four primary sources. First, the 41% reduction in unplanned downtime — from 34 hours to 20 hours per month — eliminated approximately $168,000 per year in lost production value, emergency repair costs, and overtime labor for recovery operations. Second, the 26% reduction in maintenance cost per asset — driven by catching wear items during scheduled PMs before they caused catastrophic failures — saved $79,000 across the 180-asset fleet. Third, the elimination of expedited shipping costs for customer orders delayed by equipment failures saved $31,000. Fourth, the reduction in maintenance lead administrative time (from 6 hours per week per lead to 1.5 hours per week per lead) freed 700 hours annually, which was redirected to reliability engineering projects valued at $20,000 in identified improvement opportunities.

### ISO 13485 Audit Performance

The most consequential result was the improvement in audit readiness. In the ISO 13485 surveillance audit conducted 4 months after QuickVoice deployment, the auditor reviewed PM compliance records for medical device production equipment and found zero overdue work orders. The previous audit's minor non-conformance was closed, and the auditor specifically noted the "significantly improved maintenance documentation and compliance tracking" in the audit report. For a company whose medical device customers represented 40% of revenue, maintaining ISO 13485 certification was existential.

### Vendor Relationship and Response Time

The 61% reduction in vendor scheduling time (from 2.8 days to 1.1 days) was driven by the elimination of human scheduling friction. The AI agent called vendors during their business hours, clearly communicated the service requirement, and confirmed the appointment in a single interaction. Vendors reported that the process was faster and more efficient than the previous email-and-callback cycle. Three vendors proactively asked how they could better integrate their scheduling systems with QuickVoice for even faster coordination.

> "The audit result alone justified the entire investment. We went from an auditor flagging 11 overdue PMs to zero findings on maintenance compliance. In our industry, losing ISO 13485 certification does not just cost money — it costs customers. QuickVoice did not just improve our maintenance; it protected our business."
> — Linda Nguyen, Maintenance Manager

## 7. What's Next

Building on the success of the PM coordination deployment, the company is planning three additional QuickVoice initiatives.

### Predictive Maintenance Alert Coordination

The company is in the process of deploying vibration monitoring and thermal imaging sensors on critical SMT equipment. When these sensors detect anomalies that suggest impending failure, QuickVoice will be the communication layer — instantly notifying the assigned technician, providing the sensor data and recommended diagnostic procedure, and coordinating an emergency maintenance window with the production supervisor. The goal is to catch equipment degradation 48 to 72 hours before failure, transforming what would have been unplanned downtime into planned maintenance.

### Calibration Tracking and Recall Coordination

ISO 13485 requires that all measurement and test equipment be calibrated within specified intervals. Currently, calibration recall notifications go through the same email-based process that failed for PM notifications. QuickVoice will manage the calibration recall process — notifying technicians when instruments are approaching their calibration due date, scheduling calibration appointments with the external calibration lab, and escalating overdue calibrations before they become audit findings.

### Spare Parts Inventory Voice Alerts

When spare parts inventory in Maximo drops below minimum stock levels, the current process generates an email to the procurement team. These emails are sometimes missed, resulting in stockouts when a critical part is needed for a PM or repair. QuickVoice will place immediate voice calls to the procurement lead when inventory hits the reorder point, ensuring that replenishment orders are placed before stockouts occur. For critical-path spare parts, the AI agent will also contact approved vendors to confirm availability and lead time.

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

- **The gap between planning maintenance and executing maintenance is a communication problem.** The company's PM program was well-designed in Maximo, but email notifications failed to reach technicians on the shop floor. QuickVoice voice calls achieved an 88% acknowledgment rate within 4 hours, compared to roughly 30% for email, pushing PM compliance from 72% to 96%.
- **Vendor scheduling friction is an invisible bottleneck.** The 2.8-day average to schedule a vendor service visit was accepted as normal but was entirely unnecessary. AI-automated vendor calls compressed this to 1.1 days, ensuring that equipment received required service before compliance windows closed.
- **Escalation accountability changes behavior.** The three-tier escalation protocol — with automatic calls to leads at 24 hours, the manager at 48 hours, and the plant manager at 72 hours — created a culture of PM accountability that had not existed before. Technicians and leads knew that overdue PMs would not stay invisible.
- **Maintenance compliance is a business survival issue in regulated manufacturing.** For a company where 40% of revenue depended on ISO 13485 certification, the improvement from a minor audit non-conformance to zero maintenance findings was not just an operational win — it was an existential risk reduction that no dollar figure can fully capture.

> "People think of AI as something futuristic and complicated. What QuickVoice did for us was remarkably simple — it called the right person at the right time with the right information. That is all we needed. We did not need a revolution in maintenance technology. We needed someone to actually pick up the phone and remind a technician that Machine 47 was due for a PM on Thursday. The AI does that better than any human coordinator ever could, 180 assets at a time, without forgetting a single one."

# Electronics Manufacturer Reduces Unplanned Downtime 41% with AI Maintenance Coordination

Preventive maintenance is the backbone of manufacturing reliability, but only when it actually gets done. For an electronics contract manufacturer on the West Coast, the preventive maintenance program existed on paper — meticulously planned in their CMMS, with schedules, procedures, and parts lists all properly documented. The problem was execution. PM tasks were assigned through email notifications that maintenance technicians rarely saw, vendor service calls required days of back-and-forth scheduling, and overdue work orders accumulated silently until a machine broke down and brought a production line to a halt. This is the story of how QuickVoice AI voice agents closed the gap between planned maintenance and executed maintenance, reducing unplanned downtime by 41% and delivering $298,000 in annual savings.

## 1. Company Profile

| Detail | Description |
|---|---|
| **Company Type** | Electronics contract manufacturer (PCB assembly, box build, test) |
| **Employees** | 320 (maintenance, production, engineering, and administration) |
| **Facility** | Single 185,000 sq ft manufacturing facility, West Coast |
| **Production Assets** | 180 tracked assets (SMT lines, wave solder, selective solder, AOI, ICT, functional test, environmental chambers) |
| **CMMS** | IBM Maximo |
| **Key Certifications** | ISO 13485 (medical devices), ISO 9001, IPC-A-610 Class 3 |
| **Maintenance Team** | 14 maintenance technicians, 3 maintenance leads, 1 maintenance manager |
| **Vendor Service Contracts** | 22 active contracts with OEM equipment vendors |

The company served customers in medical devices, aerospace, and industrial instrumentation — industries where product reliability is non-negotiable and manufacturing process control is subject to regulatory audit. Their ISO 13485 certification required documented evidence that preventive maintenance was performed on schedule, that calibrated equipment was within certification windows, and that any deviation was formally investigated and corrected. A missed PM was not just an operational risk; it was a compliance risk that could jeopardize their certification and their ability to serve their most important customers.

The maintenance organization was structured around three shifts, with 4 to 5 technicians per shift and a maintenance lead overseeing each. The maintenance manager, Linda Nguyen, was responsible for PM program compliance, vendor management, and maintenance budgeting. She had 18 years of experience in manufacturing maintenance and had implemented the Maximo CMMS five years earlier. The system was well-configured, with detailed PM schedules for all 180 assets, complete with task lists, estimated durations, required parts, and safety procedures. The data infrastructure was solid. The human execution layer was the failure point.

## 2. The Challenge

Linda had been fighting the PM compliance battle for years. The metrics told a frustrating story: a well-designed maintenance program that was consistently undermined by communication failures.

### PM Compliance Was Stuck at 72%

Despite having a comprehensive PM schedule in Maximo, the facility's PM compliance rate — the percentage of preventive maintenance work orders completed on or before their due date — had plateaued at 72% for over two years. Nearly one in three scheduled PMs was completed late or not at all. The root cause was not a lack of planning or resources; it was a notification problem.

When Maximo generated a PM work order, the system sent an email notification to the assigned maintenance technician. The problem was that maintenance technicians spent their days on the production floor, not at computers. Most checked email once a day at best, and many checked it only when a supervisor specifically told them to. Email notifications for PM tasks sat unread in inboxes for days. By the time a technician saw the notification, the PM was often already overdue, and the production schedule had moved on to fill the maintenance window with production runs.

### Overdue PMs Were Invisible Until Audit Time

The maintenance leads were responsible for tracking PM completion, but their visibility was limited. Maximo generated weekly compliance reports, but these were backward-looking — they told you what was already late, not what was about to become late. Leads had to manually query the system to identify upcoming PMs and then physically find technicians on the floor to assign the work. This manual tracking process consumed roughly 6 hours per week per lead, and it was inherently reactive.

The invisibility of overdue PMs became acutely painful during ISO audits. In the most recent ISO 13485 surveillance audit, the auditor flagged 11 overdue PM work orders on equipment used in medical device production. The finding resulted in a minor non-conformance that required a formal corrective action response and a follow-up audit — a process that consumed 80+ hours of management time and created anxiety throughout the organization.

### Vendor Service Scheduling Was Painfully Slow

Twenty-two production assets required periodic service by OEM vendor technicians — specialized equipment like SMT placement machines, AOI systems, and environmental test chambers that the in-house team was not qualified to maintain. Scheduling these vendor visits required back-and-forth phone calls and emails between the maintenance leads and the vendor's service dispatch. On average, it took 2.8 days from the time a vendor service request was initiated to the time a technician was confirmed and scheduled. During that 2.8-day gap, the equipment either ran without the required maintenance (a compliance risk) or sat idle (a production capacity loss).

### Unplanned Downtime Was Costing $24,000 Per Month

The direct consequence of missed PMs was equipment failure. Assets that did not receive scheduled maintenance broke down more often, and those breakdowns happened at the worst possible times — in the middle of production runs with customer delivery deadlines. The facility averaged 34 hours of unplanned downtime per month, costing approximately $24,000 per month in lost production, emergency repair costs, overtime labor for recovery, and expedited shipping to meet customer commitments.

## 3. Why QuickVoice

Linda evaluated three approaches: hiring a dedicated PM coordinator, implementing a mobile CMMS app, and deploying QuickVoice AI voice agents. The mobile app was piloted for 60 days but adoption was poor — technicians found the interface cumbersome in a shop floor environment where they wore gloves and moved between work areas constantly. The dedicated coordinator would have cost $75,000 per year and still would have relied on finding technicians and communicating verbally. QuickVoice offered a compelling alternative for four reasons.

**Voice Notifications Cut Through Shop Floor Noise.** Unlike emails that sat unread or mobile app alerts that were ignored, a phone call to a technician's mobile or the shop floor phone demanded immediate attention.

> — Linda Nguyen, Maintenance Manager

## 4. The Solution

QuickVoice deployed three interconnected capabilities: PM notification and completion tracking, vendor service auto-scheduling, and compliance escalation management.

### PM Notification and Completion Tracking

Three days before a PM work order's due date, QuickVoice placed a voice call to the assigned maintenance technician. The AI agent communicated the specific asset, PM task description, estimated duration, any required parts (confirming availability in the storeroom based on Maximo inventory data), and the due date. The technician could acknowledge the task and indicate a planned completion time, or flag a scheduling conflict that needed to be resolved with the maintenance lead.

On the due date, if the work order had not been marked complete in Maximo, QuickVoice placed a follow-up call to the technician. This call served as both a reminder and a completion capture mechanism — the technician could verbally confirm that the PM was done, and the AI agent would update the work order status in Maximo, record the completion time, and note any observations the technician wanted to log (abnormal wear, parts replaced, recommended follow-up).

For PMs that required production equipment to be taken offline, QuickVoice coordinated with production supervisors by calling them 48 hours in advance to negotiate a maintenance window that minimized production disruption. This scheduling negotiation, which previously happened informally and often fell through, was now formalized and tracked.

### Vendor Service Auto-Scheduling

When Maximo generated a work order requiring vendor service, QuickVoice initiated the vendor scheduling process within 2 hours. The AI agent called the vendor's service dispatch number, provided the equipment details and required service type, and requested available dates within the next 5 business days. The agent could negotiate between multiple available slots, selecting the option that best aligned with the facility's production schedule (which it accessed in real time from the manufacturing execution system).

Once a date and time were confirmed, the appointment was written back to Maximo as a scheduled work order, and notification calls were placed to the maintenance lead and the production supervisor for the affected area. If the vendor's earliest availability fell outside the 5-day window, the system flagged it as a potential compliance risk and escalated to the maintenance manager.

### Compliance Escalation Management

QuickVoice implemented a three-tier escalation protocol for overdue PMs:

- **Tier 1 (Due date +24 hours):** Automatic call to the assigned maintenance lead with the overdue work order details and a request to intervene.
- **Tier 2 (Due date +48 hours):** Automatic call to the maintenance manager (Linda) with a summary of all overdue PMs and their assigned technicians.
- **Tier 3 (Due date +72 hours):** Automatic call to the plant manager, signaling a systemic compliance risk requiring executive attention.

For ISO 13485-critical assets (those used in medical device production), the escalation timeline was compressed: Tier 1 at +12 hours, Tier 2 at +24 hours, Tier 3 at +48 hours.

---

## 5. Implementation

The full deployment took four weeks from contract signing to production go-live.

### Week 1: Maximo Integration and Asset Mapping

The QuickVoice engineering team established the API connection with the facility's IBM Maximo instance. All 180 tracked assets were mapped, along with their PM schedules, assigned technicians, criticality classifications, and vendor service requirements. The 22 vendor service contracts were cataloged with dispatch phone numbers, service request protocols, and typical response time benchmarks. Data security protocols were validated, and access was restricted to work order and asset data only — no financial or HR data.

### Week 2: Call Script Development and Workflow Configuration

Call scripts were developed for eight scenarios: PM advance notification, PM due-date reminder, PM completion confirmation, production window negotiation, vendor service scheduling, overdue PM escalation (three tiers), and vendor delay notification. Linda and her three maintenance leads reviewed every script for technical accuracy, ensuring that the AI agent used the correct maintenance terminology and referenced the right asset identifiers. The escalation timelines and criticality-based rules were configured and tested with simulated overdue work orders.

### Week 3: Pilot on High-Criticality Assets

The system went live for the 45 highest-criticality assets — those used in medical device and aerospace production — where PM compliance had the greatest regulatory and financial impact. Maintenance leads monitored every AI interaction for the first five days, comparing the voice notification process against the old email-based workflow. The results were immediately evident: PM acknowledgment rates jumped from roughly 30% within 24 hours (email) to 88% within 4 hours (voice). Three vendor service appointments that would have taken days to schedule were confirmed within 3 hours.

### Week 4: Full Rollout and Team Training

The system was expanded to all 180 assets. All 14 maintenance technicians, 3 leads, and the maintenance manager received 60 minutes of training on how to interact with the AI agent (confirming completions, flagging conflicts, reporting abnormal findings) and how to use the QuickVoice dashboard to monitor PM status across the facility. Production supervisors received a separate 30-minute briefing on the automated maintenance window negotiation process and how to respond to scheduling calls from the AI agent.

## 6. Results

After 90 days of full operation, Linda and the plant leadership team reviewed performance data. The results confirmed that the communication gap between the CMMS and the shop floor had been effectively closed.

| Metric | Before QuickVoice | After QuickVoice | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PM compliance rate** | 72% | 96% | **+33 percentage points** |
| **Unplanned downtime** | 34 hrs/month | 20 hrs/month | **-41%** |
| **Vendor technician response** | 2.8 days | 1.1 days | **-61%** |
| **Maintenance cost per asset** | $4,200/year | $3,100/year | **-26%** |
| **PM acknowledgment (within 4 hrs)** | ~30% (email) | 88% (voice) | **+193%** |
| **Overdue PMs at any given time** | 18-24 work orders | 3-5 work orders | **-78%** |
| **Annual savings** | — | $298,000 | — |

### Breaking Down the $298,000 in Annual Savings

The savings came from four primary sources. First, the 41% reduction in unplanned downtime — from 34 hours to 20 hours per month — eliminated approximately $168,000 per year in lost production value, emergency repair costs, and overtime labor for recovery operations. Second, the 26% reduction in maintenance cost per asset — driven by catching wear items during scheduled PMs before they caused catastrophic failures — saved $79,000 across the 180-asset fleet. Third, the elimination of expedited shipping costs for customer orders delayed by equipment failures saved $31,000. Fourth, the reduction in maintenance lead administrative time (from 6 hours per week per lead to 1.5 hours per week per lead) freed 700 hours annually, which was redirected to reliability engineering projects valued at $20,000 in identified improvement opportunities.

### ISO 13485 Audit Performance

The most consequential result was the improvement in audit readiness. In the ISO 13485 surveillance audit conducted 4 months after QuickVoice deployment, the auditor reviewed PM compliance records for medical device production equipment and found zero overdue work orders. The previous audit's minor non-conformance was closed, and the auditor specifically noted the "significantly improved maintenance documentation and compliance tracking" in the audit report. For a company whose medical device customers represented 40% of revenue, maintaining ISO 13485 certification was existential.

### Vendor Relationship and Response Time

The 61% reduction in vendor scheduling time (from 2.8 days to 1.1 days) was driven by the elimination of human scheduling friction. The AI agent called vendors during their business hours, clearly communicated the service requirement, and confirmed the appointment in a single interaction. Vendors reported that the process was faster and more efficient than the previous email-and-callback cycle. Three vendors proactively asked how they could better integrate their scheduling systems with QuickVoice for even faster coordination.

> "The audit result alone justified the entire investment. We went from an auditor flagging 11 overdue PMs to zero findings on maintenance compliance. In our industry, losing ISO 13485 certification does not just cost money — it costs customers. QuickVoice did not just improve our maintenance; it protected our business."

## 7. What's Next

Building on the success of the PM coordination deployment, the company is planning three additional QuickVoice initiatives.

### Predictive Maintenance Alert Coordination

The company is in the process of deploying vibration monitoring and thermal imaging sensors on critical SMT equipment. When these sensors detect anomalies that suggest impending failure, QuickVoice will be the communication layer — instantly notifying the assigned technician, providing the sensor data and recommended diagnostic procedure, and coordinating an emergency maintenance window with the production supervisor. The goal is to catch equipment degradation 48 to 72 hours before failure, transforming what would have been unplanned downtime into planned maintenance.

### Calibration Tracking and Recall Coordination

ISO 13485 requires that all measurement and test equipment be calibrated within specified intervals. Currently, calibration recall notifications go through the same email-based process that failed for PM notifications. QuickVoice will manage the calibration recall process — notifying technicians when instruments are approaching their calibration due date, scheduling calibration appointments with the external calibration lab, and escalating overdue calibrations before they become audit findings.

### Spare Parts Inventory Voice Alerts

When spare parts inventory in Maximo drops below minimum stock levels, the current process generates an email to the procurement team. These emails are sometimes missed, resulting in stockouts when a critical part is needed for a PM or repair. QuickVoice will place immediate voice calls to the procurement lead when inventory hits the reorder point, ensuring that replenishment orders are placed before stockouts occur. For critical-path spare parts, the AI agent will also contact approved vendors to confirm availability and lead time.

## 8. Key Takeaways

- **The gap between planning maintenance and executing maintenance is a communication problem.** The company's PM program was well-designed in Maximo, but email notifications failed to reach technicians on the shop floor. QuickVoice voice calls achieved an 88% acknowledgment rate within 4 hours, compared to roughly 30% for email, pushing PM compliance from 72% to 96%.
- **Vendor scheduling friction is an invisible bottleneck.** The 2.8-day average to schedule a vendor service visit was accepted as normal but was entirely unnecessary. AI-automated vendor calls compressed this to 1.1 days, ensuring that equipment received required service before compliance windows closed.
- **Escalation accountability changes behavior.** The three-tier escalation protocol — with automatic calls to leads at 24 hours, the manager at 48 hours, and the plant manager at 72 hours — created a culture of PM accountability that had not existed before. Technicians and leads knew that overdue PMs would not stay invisible.
- **Maintenance compliance is a business survival issue in regulated manufacturing.** For a company where 40% of revenue depended on ISO 13485 certification, the improvement from a minor audit non-conformance to zero maintenance findings was not just an operational win — it was an existential risk reduction that no dollar figure can fully capture.

> "People think of AI as something futuristic and complicated. What QuickVoice did for us was remarkably simple — it called the right person at the right time with the right information. That is all we needed. We did not need a revolution in maintenance technology. We needed someone to actually pick up the phone and remind a technician that Machine 47 was due for a PM on Thursday. The AI does that better than any human coordinator ever could, 180 assets at a time, without forgetting a single one."
