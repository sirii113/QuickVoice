# HR Tech Startup Recovers $47K/Month in At-Risk Revenue with AI Churn Intervention

**How an $8M ARR applicant tracking platform replaced silent churn with proactive voice-based NPS surveys and intervention workflows, recovering $47,000/month in at-risk revenue and transforming a 12% email response rate into a 44% voice response rate.**

---

## Company Profile

This HR technology company provides a cloud-based applicant tracking system (ATS) designed for small and mid-sized businesses with 10 to 500 employees. The platform streamlines job posting distribution, candidate screening, interview scheduling, and offer management — replacing the spreadsheet-and-email workflows that many growing companies rely on before investing in enterprise HR infrastructure.

Founded in 2018, the company has scaled to $8 million in annual recurring revenue across 1,800 active customer accounts. The team of 42 employees includes a 5-person customer success group, a 4-person support team, and a lean sales organization that drives new customer acquisition primarily through inbound marketing and free trial conversions. The average contract value is $4,400/year, with pricing based on the number of active job postings and hiring managers on the account.

Customer lifecycle data is managed in Salesforce, and the company adopted ChurnZero 18 months ago to build health scores and automate lifecycle playbooks. Despite these investments, the company struggled with a persistent and increasingly urgent churn problem.

## The Challenge

Churn at this company was silent. Customers did not complain, escalate, or request calls with account managers before leaving. They simply stopped logging in, let their job postings expire, and eventually clicked the self-serve cancellation button in the billing portal. By the time the CS team noticed an account had churned, the customer was already gone — and often had already signed with a competitor.

The company had built standard retention infrastructure: automated NPS email surveys sent quarterly, ChurnZero health scores based on login frequency and feature usage, and a cancellation flow that asked for a reason before processing the request. But each mechanism had critical blind spots:

- **NPS email surveys had a 12% response rate.** The small sample size meant the company's NPS score of +22 was based on a self-selecting group of engaged customers. Disengaged customers — the ones most likely to churn — rarely responded, creating a dangerously distorted picture of customer sentiment.
- **ChurnZero health scores identified at-risk accounts, but the CS team lacked the capacity to act on them.** With 5 CSMs managing 360 accounts each, the team could only make manual outreach to the top 10–15 most critical at-risk accounts per month. Dozens of flagged accounts received no intervention.
- **The self-serve cancellation flow captured a reason code but did nothing to prevent the cancellation.** The form was a post-mortem, not an intervention.
- **Win-back efforts were nearly nonexistent.** The company sent a single "We miss you" email 30 days after cancellation. Only 4% of churned customers returned.

The monthly churn rate sat at 3.8% — meaning the company lost roughly 68 customers per month. At $4,400 ACV, that represented $300,000/month in churning revenue, forcing the sales team to continuously backfill lost ARR before the company could grow.

> "We had all the data. ChurnZero told us exactly which accounts were at risk. But knowing which accounts are at risk and actually doing something about it are two very different things. We were drowning in red health scores and didn't have enough hands to pick up the phone."
>
> — **Head of Customer Success**

The leadership team calculated that if the company could improve its save rate on at-risk accounts from 15% to even 30%, and reduce the monthly churn rate by a single percentage point, the impact would exceed $500,000 in annual retained revenue.

## Why QuickVoice

The company evaluated expanding the CS team, outsourcing retention calls to a BPO, and deploying QuickVoice. The decision came down to three factors:

1. **ChurnZero integration for real-time health score triggers.** QuickVoice connects natively to ChurnZero, meaning it can initiate outreach calls the moment an account's health score drops below a defined threshold — not hours or days later when a CSM reviews their dashboard. Speed of intervention is the single most important variable in save rate.

2. **Voice NPS surveys with dynamic follow-up.** Unlike email surveys that collect a score and a text box, QuickVoice conducts NPS surveys as a conversation. When a customer gives a detractor score (0–6), the AI immediately asks follow-up questions to understand the root cause — and can offer solutions, schedule a CSM call, or escalate in real time. The survey becomes an intervention.

3. **Cancellation interception capability.** QuickVoice can be triggered by the self-serve cancellation event in Salesforce, initiating a "save" call before the cancellation is processed. This transforms the cancellation flow from a passive form into an active conversation where the AI can offer training, configuration adjustments, pricing modifications, or an account pause.

4. **Salesforce bi-directional sync.** Every call, every NPS score, every save attempt, and every win-back outcome syncs back to Salesforce automatically. The CS team maintains a single source of truth without any manual data entry.

> "What convinced us was the ChurnZero trigger. We had been manually reviewing health score dashboards every Monday morning and then trying to prioritize which accounts to call that week. By the time we called, some of them had already canceled. QuickVoice calls them the same day the score drops. That speed difference changes everything."

## The Solution

QuickVoice was deployed across four interconnected workflows that together form a comprehensive churn prevention system:

### Quarterly Voice NPS Surveys

Every 90 days, QuickVoice calls each customer to conduct a conversational NPS survey. The call opens with a brief check-in — "How has your experience been with [product] over the last quarter?" — before asking the standard NPS question. Based on the response, the call branches:

- **Promoters (9–10):** QuickVoice thanks them, asks if they would be willing to provide a testimonial or referral, and sends an SMS link to the review platform.
- **Passives (7–8):** QuickVoice asks what one thing would make the product a 9 or 10, captures the feedback, and logs it as a product enhancement request in Salesforce.
- **Detractors (0–6):** QuickVoice immediately shifts into diagnostic mode — asking about specific pain points, identifying whether the issue is product-related, support-related, or value-related, and offering to schedule a call with a CSM or support specialist within 24 hours. Detractor responses trigger an immediate Slack notification to the CS team.

### At-Risk Health Score Intervention

When ChurnZero flags an account with a health score below 40 (on a 0–100 scale), QuickVoice initiates an outreach call within 4 hours. The call is positioned as a proactive check-in: "We wanted to reach out because we noticed your team's usage has changed recently. We want to make sure everything is working well and see if there's anything we can help with."

The AI is equipped to handle the three most common at-risk scenarios:

- **Low login frequency:** Offers a refresher training session, suggests workflow improvements, and asks whether the customer's hiring needs have changed.
- **Feature underutilization:** Walks through specific features the account has not activated — automated interview scheduling, candidate scoring, integration with HRIS systems — and explains the time savings.
- **Support ticket frustration:** Acknowledges any unresolved tickets, provides a status update, and escalates to a support lead if the issue remains open.

### Cancellation Save Calls

When a customer initiates a cancellation through the self-serve billing portal, the system pauses the cancellation for 2 hours and triggers a QuickVoice call. The AI acknowledges the cancellation request, asks about the reason, and offers one of four retention options based on the situation:

1. **Training and onboarding refresh** if the customer cites complexity or lack of adoption.
2. **Configuration adjustment** if the customer's needs have changed and the current setup no longer fits.
3. **Pricing modification** — a one-time discount or tier adjustment — if cost is the primary concern.
4. **Account pause** for 60 or 90 days if the customer has a temporary reduction in hiring needs.

If the customer confirms they want to proceed with cancellation, QuickVoice processes it gracefully, captures detailed feedback, and schedules a win-back attempt.

### Win-Back Campaigns for Recent Churns

Customers who canceled within the last 30 to 90 days receive a QuickVoice call as part of a structured win-back campaign. The call references their specific reason for leaving, describes any product improvements or new features released since their departure, and offers a return incentive — typically a free month or a discounted annual plan. Win-back offers are personalized based on the original cancellation reason stored in Salesforce.

## Implementation

The rollout was designed for speed, given the urgency of the churn problem:

**Week 1: Integration and Data Setup**
The engineering team connected QuickVoice to ChurnZero (health scores and lifecycle events), Salesforce (customer data and call logging), and the billing system (cancellation event triggers). Health score thresholds were calibrated based on historical data — accounts that churned in the prior 12 months had an average health score of 32 at 60 days before cancellation, establishing the intervention trigger at 40.

**Week 2: Script Development and Compliance Review**
The CS team developed scripts for all four workflows. Legal reviewed the cancellation save flow to ensure compliance with the company's cancellation policy — customers can always cancel, and the AI never blocks or delays the request beyond the 2-hour save window. NPS scripts were tested against 30 mock calls with internal stakeholders.

**Week 3: NPS Survey Pilot (25% of Customer Base)**
The first quarterly NPS cycle was launched to a randomized 25% of customers. Response rate hit 41% in the first week — more than triple the email benchmark — validating the voice approach. Detractor follow-up workflows were tested and refined based on real responses.

**Week 4: At-Risk and Cancellation Workflows Activated**
Health score intervention and cancellation save calls went live across the full customer base. The CS team monitored save rates, call sentiment, and customer feedback in real time via the Salesforce dashboard.

**Week 6: Win-Back Campaign Launch**
The first win-back campaign targeted 245 customers who had churned in the prior 90 days.

## Results

After 6 months of full deployment, the churn prevention system delivered results that exceeded the leadership team's projections:

| Metric | Before QuickVoice | After QuickVoice | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| NPS response rate | 12% | 44% | **+267%** |
| NPS score | +22 | +36 | **+64%** |
| At-risk save rate | 15% | 38% | **+153%** |
| Monthly churn rate | 3.8% | 2.4% | **-37%** |
| Revenue saved (at-risk accounts) | — | $47K/month | — |
| Win-back rate (churned 30–90 days) | 4% | 16% | **+300%** |
| Annual retention improvement | — | $564K ARR saved | — |

### Deeper Impact

The quantitative results were significant, but several qualitative shifts proved equally important:

- **NPS accuracy improved dramatically.** With a 44% response rate, the NPS score became a reliable leading indicator of customer health rather than a vanity metric. The true NPS score was +36 — higher than the email-derived +22 — because voice surveys captured feedback from moderately satisfied customers who would never have filled out an email form, balancing the detractor skew.

- **Detractor recovery became a repeatable process.** Of the customers who gave a detractor score during a voice NPS survey, 31% were converted to passives or promoters within 60 days through the follow-up workflow. These recoveries would have been invisible in the email-only system.

- **Cancellation save calls changed the company's understanding of why customers leave.** The three most common cancellation reasons revealed by voice conversations were: (1) the customer's company had reduced hiring and didn't realize they could pause the account, (2) the customer had never fully set up the product and didn't see value, and (3) a single unresolved support issue that had festered for weeks. All three were addressable — they just required someone to ask.

- **Win-back calls recovered 39 accounts in the first 6 months** — representing $171,600 in recovered ARR from customers the company had already written off.

> "The most surprising insight was how many customers canceled for reasons we could have fixed if we had just talked to them. One customer told our AI they were canceling because they didn't know how to set up the interview scheduling feature. That's a 5-minute conversation, not a lost customer. How many accounts did we lose over the past two years for the same reason? I don't want to think about it."

## What's Next

With churn prevention delivering measurable ROI, the company is expanding QuickVoice into two additional revenue-impacting workflows:

1. **Expansion and upsell outreach.** QuickVoice will call customers whose usage patterns indicate they are approaching plan limits — job posting caps, hiring manager seat counts, or candidate volume thresholds — and present upgrade options with a clear value justification based on their actual usage data.

2. **Customer advocacy automation.** Promoters identified through NPS surveys will receive automated follow-up calls inviting them to participate in case studies, join the customer advisory board, or provide referrals — each of which currently relies on manual CSM outreach that happens sporadically.

3. **Annual renewal confirmation.** For customers on annual contracts, QuickVoice will conduct a structured renewal check-in 60 days before expiration — reviewing usage, confirming satisfaction, and pre-empting any renewal objections before the formal renewal notice is sent.

The company's long-term goal is to reduce net revenue churn to below 1% monthly and achieve net negative churn through the combination of retention improvements and AI-initiated expansion revenue.

## Key Takeaways

- **Silent churn is the most dangerous kind of churn.** Customers who leave without complaining give you no signal and no opportunity to intervene — unless you proactively ask. Voice NPS surveys with real-time follow-up convert a passive measurement tool into an active retention mechanism.

- **NPS email surveys systematically misrepresent customer sentiment.** A 12% response rate is not a sample — it is a self-selected group of your most engaged customers. Voice surveys triple or quadruple response rates and deliver a far more accurate picture of how your customer base actually feels.

- **Speed of intervention determines save rate.** The difference between calling an at-risk account the day the health score drops versus the following Monday is often the difference between saving the account and losing it. Automated triggers eliminate the lag between detection and action.

- **Cancellation is not the end of the conversation.** A structured save call with relevant offers — training, configuration changes, pricing adjustments, account pauses — converts more than a third of cancellation attempts into retained customers. Most SaaS companies treat cancellation as final. It does not have to be.

- **Win-back is an underinvested channel.** Customers who churned 30–90 days ago are significantly easier to win back than new prospects — they already understand the product, they have data in the system, and they often left for addressable reasons. A 16% win-back rate at minimal cost is pure recovered revenue.

> "We spent two years building ChurnZero dashboards and health scores. The data was excellent. What was missing was the action layer — something that could take all that intelligence and actually do something with it in real time. QuickVoice is that action layer."
