# Multi-Rooftop Dealer Group Cuts Service No-Shows by 35% and Lifts Absorption Rate 18%

A 4-rooftop dealer group spanning domestic and import brands across the Southeast United States deployed QuickVoice AI voice agents to overhaul its fixed-operations scheduling workflow. Within 90 days, the group eliminated after-hours call abandonment, slashed service no-shows by 35%, and added $210K in monthly service revenue -- achieving a 17x return on investment per rooftop.

---

## 1. Company Profile

This case study follows a privately held, multi-rooftop automotive dealer group headquartered in the Southeast United States. The group operates four franchise dealerships representing both domestic and import brands, employing approximately 280 team members across sales, finance, service, and parts departments.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Dealership type** | 4-rooftop franchise group (domestic + import) |
| **Region** | Southeast US (metro and suburban markets) |
| **Employees** | ~280 across all locations |
| **Monthly repair orders (ROs)** | 2,400 combined |
| **Monthly service revenue (pre-QuickVoice)** | $1.2M combined |
| **DMS platform** | CDK Global |
| **CRM platform** | Elead |

The group had invested heavily in technician training, facility upgrades, and OEM certification programs. Despite those investments, the fixed-operations department was consistently underperforming relative to its capacity. Leadership recognized that the problem was not in the bays -- it was in how customers reached, confirmed, and showed up for their appointments.

---

## 2. The Challenge

Fixed operations is the profit engine of any dealership group, yet this organization faced three compounding problems that were draining revenue and straining staff.

**No-show rates were eroding throughput.** Across all four stores, the service no-show rate hovered at 22%. That translated to roughly 528 missed appointments per month. Each missed appointment represented an average of $340 in lost labor and parts revenue, amounting to approximately $180K in annual losses. Service advisors spent the first hour of every morning scrambling to backfill empty bays, often discounting walk-in work to keep technicians productive.

**After-hours calls went entirely unanswered.** Call-tracking data showed that 35% of all inbound service calls arrived outside business hours -- evenings, weekends, and early mornings when customers had time to think about vehicle maintenance. Every one of those calls hit a voicemail box. Internal audits revealed that fewer than 12% of voicemails were returned within 24 hours. Customers simply called the next dealer on their list.

**CSI scores were stagnating.** The group's J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction Index score sat at 812, below the brand average for two of its four franchises. Customer feedback consistently cited difficulty reaching the service department and lack of proactive communication as pain points. OEM incentive thresholds were at risk.

> "We were spending six figures a year on facility upgrades, but our biggest leak was the phone. Customers couldn't get through, didn't get reminded, and didn't show up. We were fixing the wrong problem." -- Fixed Operations Director

---

## 3. Why QuickVoice

The group's leadership evaluated four solutions: hiring additional BDC staff, deploying an IVR-based scheduling tree, contracting with an offshore call center, and implementing QuickVoice AI voice agents.

**Hiring additional BDC staff** would have required 6-8 new full-time hires across the four stores to cover evenings and weekends. At a fully loaded cost of $45K per rep, that represented $270K-$360K in annual payroll before training, turnover, and management overhead.

**An IVR system** offered 24/7 coverage but tested poorly with the group's customer demographic. In a pilot survey, 68% of service customers said they would hang up rather than navigate a phone tree.

**An offshore call center** provided live-agent coverage but lacked integration with CDK. Agents could take messages but could not see real-time bay availability, advisor schedules, or open recall campaigns. Handoff errors in a two-week pilot resulted in 14 double-bookings.

**QuickVoice** offered real-time CDK integration, natural conversational AI that could look up appointment slots, confirm or reschedule existing appointments, and run outbound confirmation and CSI calls -- all without human intervention. The per-call cost was a fraction of any staffed alternative, and the integration timeline was measured in days, not months.

> "The CDK integration was the deciding factor. We needed the AI to see what our advisors see -- open slots, advisor availability, pending recalls. QuickVoice was the only option that could do that on day one." -- IT Director

---

## 4. The Solution

QuickVoice deployed a three-layer voice AI solution tailored to fixed-operations workflows.

### Layer 1: Inbound Service Scheduling

QuickVoice AI agents answer every inbound service call -- during business hours as overflow and after hours as the primary handler. The agent greets the customer by name (via caller ID matched to the DMS), identifies the requested service, checks real-time bay and advisor availability in CDK, and books the appointment. For complex or warranty-related requests, the agent warm-transfers to a live advisor with a full context summary.

### Layer 2: Day-Before Voice Confirmations

Every confirmed appointment triggers an outbound voice call 18-24 hours before the scheduled time. The AI agent confirms the appointment, offers a reschedule option if the customer's plans have changed, and reminds the customer of any open recalls or recommended services based on mileage and service history pulled from CDK. Customers who cancel or reschedule are immediately re-slotted, freeing the bay for other bookings.

### Layer 3: Post-Service CSI Follow-Up

Within 48 hours of repair order closure, QuickVoice calls the customer to ask about their experience. The agent uses a five-question framework aligned with J.D. Power CSI survey methodology. Negative responses trigger an immediate alert to the service manager, who can intervene before the customer submits an OEM survey.

All three layers feed data into a centralized dashboard with per-store, per-advisor, and per-campaign analytics.

---

## 5. Implementation

The rollout followed a phased approach designed to minimize disruption and build internal confidence.

| Phase | Timeline | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1: Discovery & Integration** | Week 1-2 | CDK API connection, DMS field mapping, appointment-type taxonomy, advisor schedule sync |
| **Phase 2: Pilot Store** | Week 3-4 | Single rooftop (highest no-show rate), inbound + confirmation calls only |
| **Phase 3: Calibration** | Week 5-6 | Script refinement based on call recordings, escalation logic tuning, advisor feedback sessions |
| **Phase 4: Full Rollout** | Week 7-8 | All 4 rooftops, all 3 call layers (inbound, confirmation, CSI) |
| **Phase 5: Sales BDC Expansion** | Week 9-12 | Internet lead response and appointment setting for sales department |

**CDK integration** was completed in 5 business days. QuickVoice's pre-built CDK connector handled appointment creation, modification, cancellation, and recall lookups without custom middleware. The IT team's involvement was limited to granting API credentials and validating test transactions.

**Training** for service advisors consisted of a single 90-minute session per store. Advisors learned how to review AI-set appointments in CDK, handle warm transfers, and access the QuickVoice dashboard. Adoption was immediate -- advisors appreciated that the AI handled the repetitive scheduling calls, freeing them to focus on walk-in customers and upselling.

**Escalation logic** was refined during the pilot phase. Initially, the AI transferred 18% of calls to a live advisor. After script adjustments and expanded intent recognition, the transfer rate dropped to 7%, with 93% of inbound scheduling calls handled end-to-end by the AI.

> "We thought the advisors would push back. Instead, they asked why we hadn't done this sooner. They were tired of playing phone tag. Now they focus on the customer standing in front of them." -- Service Manager, Store #2

---

## 6. Results

Performance was measured over a 90-day period following full rollout across all four rooftops.

### Key Performance Metrics

| Metric | Before QuickVoice | After QuickVoice | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Service no-show rate** | 22% | 14% | -35% |
| **Service absorption rate** | 68% | 80% | +18% |
| **After-hours calls answered** | 0% | 100% | -- |
| **Monthly service revenue** | $1.2M | $1.41M | +$210K (+17.5%) |
| **J.D. Power CSI score** | 812 | 831 | +19 points |
| **ROI per rooftop** | -- | 17x | -- |
| **Avg. inbound call handle time** | 4 min 20 sec | 2 min 45 sec | -37% |
| **Voicemail callbacks within 24 hrs** | 12% | N/A (no voicemail) | -- |

### Revenue Impact Breakdown

The $210K monthly revenue increase came from three sources:

1. **Recovered no-show revenue ($115K/mo):** Reducing no-shows from 528 to 336 per month recovered approximately 192 appointments at an average RO value of $340, netting roughly $65K in direct recovery. Additionally, the day-before confirmation calls surfaced $50K in recall and upsell opportunities that would have otherwise been missed.

2. **After-hours appointment capture ($62K/mo):** Previously lost after-hours callers now book directly with the AI. The group captured an average of 182 incremental appointments per month from after-hours calls.

3. **CSI-driven retention ($33K/mo):** The 19-point CSI improvement pushed two stores above OEM incentive thresholds, unlocking bonus allocations. More importantly, service retention rates climbed from 41% to 48%, adding recurring revenue from customers who previously defected after a poor communication experience.

### Operational Efficiency Gains

The group avoided hiring 6 additional BDC representatives, saving approximately $270K in annual payroll. The existing BDC team was redeployed to high-value outbound campaigns -- equity mining, service contract renewals, and conquest marketing -- activities that generate revenue rather than simply managing inbound volume.

---

## 7. What's Next

Building on the success in fixed operations, the dealer group has already expanded QuickVoice into its sales BDC operation. Within the first 60 days of sales deployment, internet lead response times dropped from 3.8 hours to under 2 minutes, and the appointment-show rate for test drives increased by 22%.

The group's next planned initiatives include:

- **Parts department outbound calling:** Notifying wholesale and retail customers when back-ordered parts arrive, reducing parts-counter hold times and improving wholesale customer retention.
- **Recall campaign automation:** Running targeted outbound campaigns for open safety recalls, increasing recall completion rates and capturing associated warranty labor revenue.
- **Spanish-language support:** Deploying bilingual AI agents to serve the group's growing Hispanic customer base, estimated at 18% of the service customer population.
- **Multi-location centralized BDC:** Consolidating all four rooftops under a single QuickVoice-powered virtual BDC, enabling cross-store appointment routing based on bay availability and technician specialization.

> "QuickVoice started as a service scheduling tool for us. Now it's becoming the communication backbone of the entire group. We're looking at every customer touchpoint and asking, 'Can the AI handle this better and faster than we do today?' The answer is usually yes." -- Dealer Principal

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

**No-shows are a scheduling problem, not a customer problem.** The group's 22% no-show rate was not caused by unreliable customers. It was caused by a lack of proactive confirmation and easy rescheduling options. When customers received a day-before voice call with a one-tap reschedule option, no-shows dropped by 35%.

**After-hours coverage is not optional for fixed operations.** More than a third of service call volume occurs outside business hours. Every unanswered call is a customer who books with a competitor. AI voice agents eliminate that leakage entirely at a fraction of the cost of staffed coverage.

**DMS integration is the difference between automation and real intelligence.** Generic call-handling solutions can take messages. QuickVoice's CDK integration enables the AI to actually book, confirm, and reschedule appointments in the system of record. That distinction is what drives the 93% end-to-end resolution rate without human involvement.

**CSI improvements compound over time.** The 19-point J.D. Power CSI increase was not just a feel-good metric. It unlocked OEM incentive bonuses, improved service retention rates, and gave the group a competitive advantage in customer satisfaction rankings that drives future sales.

**Start with service, then expand.** Fixed operations is the ideal entry point for AI voice agents in automotive retail. The workflows are structured, the ROI is immediate, and advisor buy-in comes quickly. Once the team sees results in service, expanding to sales BDC, parts, and F&I becomes a natural next step.

## 6. Results

Performance was measured over a 90-day period following full rollout across all four rooftops.

### Key Performance Metrics

| Metric | Before QuickVoice | After QuickVoice | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Service no-show rate** | 22% | 14% | -35% |
| **Service absorption rate** | 68% | 80% | +18% |
| **After-hours calls answered** | 0% | 100% | -- |
| **Monthly service revenue** | $1.2M | $1.41M | +$210K (+17.5%) |
| **J.D. Power CSI score** | 812 | 831 | +19 points |
| **ROI per rooftop** | -- | 17x | -- |
| **Avg. inbound call handle time** | 4 min 20 sec | 2 min 45 sec | -37% |
| **Voicemail callbacks within 24 hrs** | 12% | N/A (no voicemail) | -- |

### Revenue Impact Breakdown

The $210K monthly revenue increase came from three sources:

1. **Recovered no-show revenue ($115K/mo):** Reducing no-shows from 528 to 336 per month recovered approximately 192 appointments at an average RO value of $340, netting roughly $65K in direct recovery. Additionally, the day-before confirmation calls surfaced $50K in recall and upsell opportunities that would have otherwise been missed.

2. **After-hours appointment capture ($62K/mo):** Previously lost after-hours callers now book directly with the AI. The group captured an average of 182 incremental appointments per month from after-hours calls.

3. **CSI-driven retention ($33K/mo):** The 19-point CSI improvement pushed two stores above OEM incentive thresholds, unlocking bonus allocations. More importantly, service retention rates climbed from 41% to 48%, adding recurring revenue from customers who previously defected after a poor communication experience.

### Operational Efficiency Gains

The group avoided hiring 6 additional BDC representatives, saving approximately $270K in annual payroll. The existing BDC team was redeployed to high-value outbound campaigns -- equity mining, service contract renewals, and conquest marketing -- activities that generate revenue rather than simply managing inbound volume.

## 7. What's Next

Building on the success in fixed operations, the dealer group has already expanded QuickVoice into its sales BDC operation. Within the first 60 days of sales deployment, internet lead response times dropped from 3.8 hours to under 2 minutes, and the appointment-show rate for test drives increased by 22%.

The group's next planned initiatives include:

- **Parts department outbound calling:** Notifying wholesale and retail customers when back-ordered parts arrive, reducing parts-counter hold times and improving wholesale customer retention.
- **Recall campaign automation:** Running targeted outbound campaigns for open safety recalls, increasing recall completion rates and capturing associated warranty labor revenue.
