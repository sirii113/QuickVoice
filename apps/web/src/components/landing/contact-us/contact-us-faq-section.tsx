      "What types of voice agents can QuickVoice create for my business?",

  {
    question: "How quickly can I deploy a voice agent for my business?",
    answer:
      "There is no universal production timeline. A local evaluation still needs the documented host prerequisites, while real calls need LiveKit plus Twilio or Telnyx credentials. Production timing depends on integrations, data, testing, security, legal, and operational review.",

  {
    question:
      "Can voice agents integrate with my existing CRM and business systems?",
    answer:
      "QuickVoice includes API, MCP, and custom tool paths that can be adapted for approved external systems. Confirm each target system, authentication method, data contract, side effect, rate limit, and failure path before treating it as an integration.",
  },
  {
    question: "What languages and accents do your voice agents support?",
    answer:
      "Language and voice availability depends on the speech and voice providers configured in your deployment. Test every intended language, accent, terminology set, transfer rule, and fallback path before publishing a support claim.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure voice agent quality and accuracy?",
    answer:
      "Quality is workflow-specific. Build a representative test set, evaluate tool completion and handoffs, monitor failures, review recordings or transcripts where lawful, and keep high-impact decisions with authorized humans.",
  },
  {
    question: "What security and compliance measures are in place?",
    answer:
      "The repository makes relevant paths inspectable, but it does not establish a certification or compliance status. Review the exact deployment, providers, contracts, access controls, retention, logs, incident response, and operating procedures with qualified owners.",
  },

    question: "How quickly can I get started with QuickVoice?",

    question: "Do I need technical knowledge to use QuickVoice?",
